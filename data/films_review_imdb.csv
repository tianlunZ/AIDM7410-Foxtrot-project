0,英雄,1,PolishBear,"Some reviewers have suggested that the storyline of this movie is a bit plodding and portentous, and I'd be willing to allow that. But even if this film had absolutely no plot to speak of, I would have considered the money I plunked down yesterday to see ""Hero"" to be money well-spent, because I have been witness to some of the most achingly beautiful film-making I've ever seen. As in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" the characters here fly through the air and dance across water, but ""Crouching Tiger"" surely could have benefited from the sublime camera eye of ""Hero."" One scene of swordplay in particular that takes place in a grove of trees amongst swirling yellow leaves almost stopped my heart in my chest: It was that gorgeous. And yes, there is a plot also, one that involves various assassins with names like Sky, and Broken Sword, and Flying Snow. I have to admit that the tales and counter-tales told were a bit confusing at first, but by the time the film is over, all the pieces have fallen into place, and this chapter of ancient Chinese history has assumed a truly mythical quality. At a time when movie theaters show a lot of utter dreck, we ought to be supporting movies like this."
1,英雄,2,rserrano,"Hero is noteworthy on at least two counts.First, there are scenes of haunting beauty(""Duel in the yellow forest"" and ""Turquoise autumn"" to site a couple) that, like the best of impressionist paintings, are so affecting that you will forever see the world in a slightly different way having once beheld them.Secondly, the overall message of the film is a provocative one. The claim is that a degree of human casualties and suffering may be the optimal path to a better world, especially when the alternative is equally brutal chaos. This is not a popular theme. It has become much more fashionable to be anti-war in all cases. And understandably so, since variations of this logic have often been used in the past to justify atrocities. But the film provides a crisp litmus test for avoiding delusion: action must be taken with a heart void of malice and an unwavering commitment to the broadest possible ultimate outcome of good for all. Can anyone live up to this standard? Several characters in the movie do, each in their own way. If the standard could be met, would the world be a better place? These are questions worth reflecting on that have not been dealt with, to this depth, in any film I'm aware of."
2,英雄,3,horna-nsbm-proud,"Beautiful story, albeit a little a little convoluted, beautiful characters and sexy actress in a superb action movie.What else could anyone ask for?"
3,英雄,4,tacfoa,"I have no idea how the script and directing and cinematography came together, but whatever the formula it is a film that slows you to think, to enjoy the screen and gives you action. The almond eyed beauty is also thin and comely."
4,英雄,5,rcropperUK,"Rarely have I been so astounded by such a magnificent, awe-inspiring film. If you have not yet placed your eyes on this masterpiece of Chinese cinema then I cannot recommend this film highly enough. 'Hero' is by far the best Chinese film I have ever seen, and already a firm favourite of all time.The imagery is unparallelled, simply draw-droppingly near perfect scenes, with bold and vibrant use of colour, symbolism and scenery. The fluent flow of the storyline, the delicate direction of the sword slicing action, the Chinese cultural concepts and the emotionally charged scenes between characters combine to produce a simply remarkable achievement. This film has a few elements from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but is far, far superior in every way. The sleek direction from Yimou Zhang is so perfectly done, just imagine two martial arts experts ensuing in battle against each other, defying the laws of physics as we know it, and yet following them in 360 degrees in slow motion as one deflects a droplet of rain from one sword to the other, at the same time spinning and leaping over water... simply beautiful. The attack sequences are also superbly set, with hundreds of thousands of the King's warriors in formation, simultaneously firing enough arrows into the city which literally cover the sky, in addition to the viewer being able to watch the journey of a single arrowhead aimed during this event. The build up to the attack along with the unnerving tune of a Chinese stringed instrument help you, as the audience, to become firmly engrossed in your seat. The individual martial arts is also second to none, for myself particularly to see the distant shots of the whole battle sequence showing the true skills involved with fighting, such as footwork, perfect timing,aggression, counter attacks and defence. Jet Li shows he is truly the grand daddy of martial arts. I cannot stress enough how much you need this film in your life. The colourful imagery imposed by the director will take your breath away with luscious, vivid, bright, wind-blown,draped backgrounds as the setting for the important progression of the story. Even the story itself is brought to the audience in such a way which ensures your undivided attention, as there are twists in the tales and hidden plots which do not develop until the end of the film.Even short individual scenes are memorable due to their sheer awesome display of skill and speed. This film even holds a political message which is relevant to all times, especially in today's American-lead world dominance. This film has absolutely everything - including an extremely sexy young Ziyi Zhang who simply is the biggest hype to come out of china since SARS. This film was released in 2002, but this is certainly one of my all time favourites and will probably be the best film I see all year. I have never been more enthusiastic to pursue films in this genre in my life. For more action type enthusiasts who like more gore and violence check out 'Ong Bak', but for people who appreciate a fuller, visionary piece of martial arts filming, this will leave you speechless."
5,英雄,6,mrwiseguy,"While i enjoyed this movie very much, i believe Hero will get the kinds of reviews and responses that Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (CTHD) did, and still does, ie. either you liked it very much, or you couldn't see what the fuss was all about.  This dichotomy of opinions makes for interesting study because it seems to cut across cultural and intellectual differences. Everywhere the film is shown, there will a segment of the audience that will love and rave about it, and another segment that will be wondering if they had been watching the same movie.  I can't explain why this is so, but i suspect it has a lot to do with a viewer's initial expectation of the movie, and then his perception and appreciation of the nuances in the telling of the storyline.Hero is a film that is beautiful in many aspects.  The direction and photography is artsy without being pretentious.  Every shot is worthy of being a work of art in itself.  The language spoken is traditional mandarin, but oh, so easy to the ear, even though i couldn't understand every word. (I don't think Tony's and Maggie's voices were dubbed, but i could be mistaken).  The main characters were very well acted out, especially that of the role of the Qin Emperor.  Zhang Ziyi's character was largely insignificant though, so i think she's been put in to add some star power to the production.  The fighting scenes are unusual by most standards, employing an interesting combination of CGI and real action.  Some of the powers that the characters possess appear too amazing to be true, but remember that some of the fights only took place in the fighters' imagination.  The music, though quite similar to that in CTHD, is appropriate, and sticks hauntingly to the back of your mind long after the movie is over.I went to the cinema having heard some of the hype leading to the movie, but with no real knowledge of the storyline, and not expecting a lot.  I think that helped me enjoy the movie more, because the way the story unfolded actually set me thinking and anticipating in a manner that i could not have had i known more about the storyline.  The message at the end of the movie is simple, but certainly open for debate.  In fairness, i don't think the director attempted to provide an answer, as to whether the decision made by the Nameless One was the correct one or not, but rather to ask questions. I'd better not give out too much here, but it certainly set me thinking about things for a little while after the show had ended.  These days, any movie that can get me pondering after the credits go down has got to be pretty good.Overall an excellent movie.  I'm sure some areas could be better, but i can't think of any right now.  Highly recommended.Score: 8.5/10"
6,英雄,7,the_usual_suspect,"After two years of hearing about the myth of the most expensive Chinese film ever made, Hero has finally floated on to British cinema screens. As it flies, it trails a coloured cloth that carries the film's numerous morals and messages which descend upon you like a soft layer of fabric. This is a film that can lift your spirits and have you laughing out in sheer joy as you gaze in wonder at the perfection of the mise-en-scene and cinematography. That is, if you let the film take you on a journey, without pondering the films questionable plot points.Hero is two sides of a tale as presented by Nameless (Jet Li), a mere Prefect who defeated three deadly assassins, and the King of Qin (Daoming Chen), the man the assassins wished to kill. Nameless weaves his heroic though modest story of how he killed the assassins, but the King remains unconvinced, spinning his own version of how he believed events unfolded.Director Yimou Zhang takes us through Nameless' story first, spreading the battle sequences thick, allowing them to take their own time. In the King's version, certain battles are then revised, which is remarkably brave considering that some battles are utter fabrications. In one such fictitious fight, in a faultlessly designed set, Nameless and Sky (Donnie Yen) close their eyes and fight out the battle within their minds. Screen time is being spent lavishly on showing how two characters contemplated a fight, whilst fighting each other in a battle that never occurred. It is confusing certainly, but perhaps Zhang wished for his audience to get lost in the plot's design so that they would not question the warrantability of half of the battle sequences, which make up most of the film.Yet, it is difficult to ponder these details when they are made so utterly insignificant when viewing such a spectacle. The sheer beauty of the battles, the gentle floating of the assassins as they fly around their arenas (which range from a forest full of orange leafed trees, crisp leaves falling down to the ground like rain, to the crystal clear and calm of a mountain lake), the costumes of characters at varying stages in the story line (red for passion, green for youth, white for truth, blue for love), the amazing army scenes which feature thousands of arrows being fired into the sky to create a black cloud that descends right on top of the camera, all these elements combine to produce a faultlessly perfect image on the screen, each frame a worthy photograph that gently reminds you why cinema is the greatest art form of the twentieth century.And characterisation is not lost in this beauty as one may have feared. Despite the irritating two dimensional performance of Zhang Ziyi as Moon, the other actors carry off fine performances, especially Tony Leung Chiu Wai as Broken Sword and Daoming Chen as the King. Their performances are especially credible as they are often drowning in the memories of the King and Nameless - they need to change slight mannerisms in order to reflect whose mind they are now in.The script too is of an impressively high standard. The moments of clarity that the warriors feel are experienced by the audience also, and there are some very informed outlooks of the emptiness of warfare, communicating that to achieve peace, sometimes war is the only option. These messages of course seem fitting in our current times, underlining how ancient some of the methods of our governing body truly are. Hero is undoubtedly a most beautiful and awe inspiring film. What it lacks in plot substance, it makes up for with structure and script. It elaborates on the ground work created by 'Crouching Tiger' and is an experience that I would encourage you to seek out, as long as you are willing to submit to the film and let it guide you through its world on its own terms.Rating: 4/5"
7,英雄,8,DP-4,"Before I give my review, let me offer one suggestion that will help you appreciate this film. DO NOT SEE IT JUST ONCE. Watch it twice and then pass judgment. The film is so visually and artistically captivating that the plot can be harder to grasp the first time around. The second time around you'll get a better appreciation for the film.I viewed this film with high expectations. People were comparing it with Crouching Tiger and I really enjoyed that film. Within the first 10 minutes you understand why the comparisons are made. The cinematography, editing, music and special effects are similar. The stories, however, are quite different, and I found the story to be better than the one in Crouching Tiger.The story is about an assassin who concocts a plan to kill a king who had been trying to conquer his home land in pre-unified China. His assassination plan requires him to get close enough to the king to strike him dead. The movie shows the assassin's plan through a series of flashbacks, and culminates with the assassin getting his chance to kill the king.The beauty of this film is the how the assassin becomes a ""Hero"". I won't spoil how he achieves this, but that is what made the film great for me. It made the film more than just a visual and musical masterpiece. It also made it more than just a Kung Fu picture. It actually added a decent plot to the film which made it worth while. Honestly, I was just expecting a good Kung Fu picture. Hero is actually a great overall movie which just happens to accent the film with some of the best Kung Fu action in recent years.Definitely the best movie that I have seen this year. I hope it wins big at the awards ceremonies. It was impressive.-- DP."
8,英雄,9,Thalia115,"A few things about this film struck me. My background coming into it is as an East Asian Studies major - I studied the language, culture, literature, film, history, religion, and politics of China. This was all done in undergrad so I am by no means the last word on the subject.First of all, I noticed heavy use of Daoist symbols. The five elements were used - one per fight - fire, wind, water, wood, and metal. A message in the film seemed to show the Daoist idea that the harder you try, the worse you do, as Moon did in her fights. On the other hand, if you can go with the Dao (think: Use the force, Luke), you will succeed.Second, I did not know before watching the film that it was Zhang Yimou's. His films are often critical of the Chinese Communist Party and sometimes have deep allegorical meaning. Some of his films are banned in China. Hero, on the other hand, seemed to be intensely nationalistic. Lately in China, the communist government has promoted nationalism (instead of populist Communist values as they did pre-1976) with a great degree of success. The use of the word ""Tianxia"" (literally ""all under heaven,"" translated in the movie was ""Our Land"") seems Confucian and nationalistic at the same time. Although I would have not guessed this film was by Zhang Yimou from the plot or message, the cinematography was unmistakable. Hero eerily reminded me of another film, Yellow Earth (Huang Tudi), which Zhang Yimou did not direct but for which he did the cinematography.Third, historically, Hero lacked in a few very obvious places. The Qin Emperor, Qin Shi Huang, was legendary for his fear of death and his Machiavellian rule. When his character states that he no longer fears death because of Broken Sword's words and invites Nameless to kill him, he is entirely breaking with the true historical figure of the emperor. Remember, this is the emperor who built an entire terracotta army to protect him from his enemies in death and spent a lot of money and effort looking for the secret to reach immortality. He was known for a Confucian philosophy spin-off known as Legalism, which is very similar to Western Machiavellianism. While his quick mind (or his advisor's) might have figured out Nameless's plot, he would never have hesitated in executing him.Overall, this seems like a break from the usual genre one would expect from Zhang Yimou. I am not sure exactly what message he is trying to convey with this film, other than an endorsement of Chinese nationalism and perhaps Daoism as well."
9,英雄,10,simon_booth,"It sounded like a HK Cinema fan's ultimate wet dream... Zhang Yimou to direct a martial arts epic with Jet Li, Maggie Cheung, Leung Chiu Wai, Zhang Ziyi and Donnie Yen in the cast, Ching Siu-Tung doing the action, Christopher Doyle the cinematography and Emil Wada the costumes. What more could you ask for? (Well, Brigitte Lin coming out of retirement and Yuen Wo Ping and Sammo Hung sharing the action director credits, perhaps).I guess we have CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON to thank for making the wu xia world bankable again, and generating the interest and investment required to bring a project of this stature together. There's no doubt that the US Market was a major target, and US$ went into the funding. Given this it's a tragedy that Yimou let Miramax get their paws on it and effectively ruin any chances it had of major US successApart from Zhang Ziyi and the Tan Dun soundtrack (a terrible choice no doubt enforced by US investors), CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON is not a good reference point by which to evaluate HERO. Much more appropriate is Wong Kar Wai's ASHES OF TIME, with which it shares two lead actors and a cinematographer. HERO is definitely more commercially oriented, but shares a beauty and philosophical richness with AOT, and a certain melancholy mood.The story of HERO starts off quite simply, as Jet Li begins to recount his martial triumphs to the Emperor of Qin. The tale is told in flashbacks which revisit and re-evaluate the same events, elaborating on and changing the story as we learn more. It's reminiscent of Akira Kurosawa's RASHOMON, and is a great way of developing a mystery thriller. Zhang Yimou handles the building of the tale expertly, as one would expect from such a master film maker.Zhang Yimou himself is such an accomplished cinematographer he hardly needed to hire somebody else for the job - but if there's anybody better than Yimou it's Christopher Doyle. I wonder how much conflict there was on set though, as I am sure each had very strong visions of how they wanted scenes to look. The result doesn't show any signs of it if such a conflict occured though, as the visual style seems exceptionally strong and focussed throughout. A large part of this is Yimou's use of bold colours to delineate the different sections of the story (The green, the red, the yellow, the blue, the white). With Emil Wada's stunning costumes and the great choice of locations, HERO is almost as rich in stunning imagery as ASHES OF TIME. It's a true work of art, harking back to Yimou's older films like SHANGHAI TRIAD and RAISE THE RED LANTERN - I'm really pleased to see him making such visual films again. The visuals are sometimes let down by some unconvincing CGI effects, unfortunately.Zhang Yimou has never directed an action movie before, so people were clearly worried he wouldn't know what to do with the fight scenes that a wu xia movie needs more than anything else. It's been quite a few years since Ching Siu Tung has produced any really impressive work too, so I was rather worried - especially when I heard (from good authority) that Yimou had Ching had clashed on set. Apparently Zhang wanted more grounded, realistic kung fu, which really isn't Ching Siu Tung's thing (should have got Sammo or Yuen Wo Ping!). I guess Ching got the upper hand in the end, as the fight scenes are certainly not grounded or realistic - they're very much about the twirling and whirling and the graceful flying that Ching Siu Tung virtually defined. They're not as manic as he usually makes the action when he directs himself, though - a fact that sometimes makes the wirework look a bit awkward.A real surprise is that the weakest fight scene of the film is that one that pits the two best martial artists together. Jet Li vs. Donnie Yen opens the film with some sword vs. spear action. There's some beautiful moments, but I felt the scene lacked impact and featured some awkward moves too. Oddly enough, the fight I enjoyed the most featured no real martial artistry at all - Maggie Cheung vs (well, you'll see) in a beautiful autumnal scene of falling leaves. I guess that's because Ching Siu Tung is really not working to his strengths when he tries to do ""real"" martial arts.I had held off watching HERO for months, because as soon as I got the first released DVD (the DVD-5 from Guang Dong Face Ah) it was announced that the extended version of the film would be released in a few weeks. It's generally well known now that Zhang Yimou was persuaded to cut about 20 minutes from the film by the hatchet men at MiramAXE, who really must die first when the revolution comes. I figured the first time I see it I should see the best possible version, for maximum impact, so I was willing to wait. Well it's been 2 months now and the extended version is now indefinitely delayed due to legal issues, so I finally gave in and watched the DVD I'd had lying around for so long. Now that I've seen it I have to say I don't really see what another 20 minutes would add to the film - it seems quite complete and well paced at about 95 minutes. A little more development of Donnie Yen's character would be nice, but other than that it's hard to imagine what is missing. Longer action scenes maybe? Or perhaps just 20 minutes of Christopher Doyle's beautifully composed landscape shots, or close ups of Maggie Cheung dying.I'm glad I waited to see the film anyway though, as it allowed all the hype and anticipation to die down.  Unfortunately, when a film is as highly anticipated as this it's inevitable that there will be ""backlash syndrome"" as people feel let down that it wasn't the ultimate movie of all time they heard/hoped it would be (it was amusing to watch the reviews on CROUCHING TIGER swing between ""incredible"" and ""awful"" as hype waves ruined the experience for many, and I'm sure the same will happen with HERO).Zhang Yimou is an extremely talented director in many respects, but perhaps the greatest is his ability to get incredible performances out of his cast. With such an illustrious cast on board he perhaps felt he didn't need to try as much though (or they weren't willing to listen), as the acting isn't as powerful as I had expected. It's still of a very high quality, but doesn't evoke the same strong emotions as some of the performances in ASHES OF TIME. Leung Chiu-Wai gets the top award for acting though, which will surprise few people. Zhang Ziyi only has a small part, but shows a lot of talent too - nice to see such skill in somebody that still has most of her career ahead of her. Of course, it was Zhang Yimou that discovered and nurtured her talent in THE ROAD HOME.There are only two disappointments in HERO, for me. One is the special effects, which aren't up to the very latest standards. A little less use of CGI would have made it go a lot further (like in CTHD). The other is the soundtrack, which is really just much too similar to the Crouching Tiger soundtrack. It doesn't fit HERO as well, but it is still pretty evocative and effective - just too similar to CTHD.I still intend to pick up the extended version of HERO when it's released, to see what Zhang Yimou's ideal vision for the film was. Even running shorter than he really wanted it's a mighty fine film though, and one I have no hesitation in recommending if anybody hasn't seen it yet. If MiramAXE ever do get round to releasing it in the US, I hope it does well."
10,英雄,11,ccthemovieman-1,"After two viewings, I am still not sure what to make of this film, story-wise. I have no problems exalting praise for the cinematography which, for many people, was the drawing point. It's what got me to watch the movie. I had heard it was the most beautiful film ever made. Well, I wouldn't go that far, but it IS visually spectacular. It's even more appreciated now that I watched one of the documentaries in which I learned to what great lengths director Yimou Zhang the crew went to, to make this look so good. It took a lot of patience, waiting for just the right conditions, such as the smooth, silvery lake which only was calm two hours a day.Overall, I didn't think the story was that appealing except for the good message at the end, about the good of all being more important than satisfying one's personal vengeance. Well, who could argue with that? As for the rest, perhaps being a Westerner unfamiliar with Eastern culture, it's harder for me to relate to the mind-set. I would be interested to know how Asians viewed this story, as opposed to similar films.Sometimes I think these wild Crouching Tiger-like action scenes are too long and overdone, but at least in this film they were very original and, once again, more visuals feasts than anything else. On my second viewing, I discarded the subtitles and went with the dubbed version to concentrate more on the stunning look of this film. It paid off. Even if I don't quite follow everything, each scene is such eye-candy that you can't go wrong viewing this."
11,英雄,12,brokencode2002,"Director Zhang Yimou's Hero is playing around the country to widespread critical acclaim. It is undoubtedly one of the most visually beautiful movies of our time. However, American audiences may not fully appreciate what message comes wrapped in this beautiful package.Hero rewrites history's judgment on the movie's central figure, the Emperor Qin  a ruthless leader who unified China through the most brutal means  by depicting him as a tough but benevolent and misunderstood monarch, in the process also changing the story of the failed assassination attempt on him as well.The historical Emperor Qin was known for his cruelty. The movie does refer to his practice of slaughtering entire villages. It is silent about the tortures he employed, the draconian legal code that involved the cutting off of limbs, his burning of books and suppression of schools of thought, or such incidents as the burying alive of hundreds of scholars who had objected to his rule.The reason for the differences between the historical Emperor Qin and the movie's retelling may be found in the needs of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).Even before unifying China, the then-King of Qin was hated and feared by both rivals and subjects alike. The neighboring state of Yan (replaced with ""Zhao"" in the movie) knew that the state of Qin aimed eventually to attack. Officials in the Yan kingdom hired an assassin to kill the King of Qin and help them escape imminent defeat. Jing Ke, the man selected for the job, had to find a method to bring himself close to the King to complete his mission. Pan Yuqi was a disgruntled Qin official who had fled to the state of Yan to escape from the King of Qin's tyrannical rule. He so hated the King of Qin that he offered to allow himself to be killed in order that Jing could gain access by bringing his head to the despot. Jing killed him and brought both Pan's head and a map of the state of Yan that the king coveted, hiding in it a dagger with which to assassinate the tyrant.The King of Qin indeed allowed Jing Ke in his presence, and as the king opened the map offered to him, the assassin deftly procured the knife hidden in the map scroll. Unfortunately, Jing's initial thrust was not strong enough, grazing but not wounding the king. The king was then able to unsheathe his sword and parry any of Jing's successive thrusts. The assassin had no choice but to hurl his weapon at the monarch, but missed. He was later executed.In Hero, the assassin (played by Jet Li) has the opportunity and the skill to dispatch the King, yet decides against it. After abandoning his decision to kill the king, he is executed, and then buried as a hero.The Jet Li character is called ""Nameless."" Nameless chooses loyalty, and his own death, after a long conversation with the King of Qin. The king asserts that Nameless's quest is only negative, he acts out of hatred and revenge. He reveals that he himself is misunderstood, that the king's strength is used for the sake of unifying a great Chinese nation, a nation that will comprise ""everything under heaven"" (this crucial phrase was translated in English as ""our land"").Like the Emperor Qin, Mao Zedong, upon winning the civil war against Chiang Kai Sheik, unified China. Mao was an open admirer of the Qin Emperor. This often-hated emperor came to be seen as a symbol for the Communist Party.Since the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, the Chinese Communist Party has used China's state controlled media to make the claim that the Communist Party exists for the sake of a great and unified China. Love of China and love of the Party are conflated, and love of China is taught to be of supreme importance.Zhang's movie fits the CCP script very neatly. It appropriates China's history, its founding moment, the unification by the Emperor Qin, and uses that history to teach the very same lessons that CCP has taught: the need to give up individual claims (what we today call rights) for the sake of a great and powerful China under the rule of a strong leader (the CCP).The leaders of the CCP wish the viewers of the movie to forget some other parallels with the Emperor of Qin. Similar to the Qin Emperor, the People's Republic of China is one of the most brutal and reviled governments in the world. Just as the Emperor of Qin suppressed Confucianism and persecuted those who objected to his rule, the CCP persecutes and tortures all of those with views and beliefs differing from the Party, including Falun Gong practitioners, house Christians, Uigher Muslims, union organizers, and democracy activists."

13,英雄,14,tedg,"Two things interesting about this project. First, the sad news, at least for the Chinese, that the Japanese have finally won. This is a Japanese film in all important respects: the theming by lush color, the rather modern notion of benevolent conquest (genuinely originating in the Persians but only used since as justification for selfish empire, specifically in this case Japanese conquest - and adopted by the Chinese only since the war) and of course the wholesale swallowing of Kurosawa.Kurosawa is here obviously in the story: it is half 'Rashomon' and half 'Ran.' But more important is Kurosawa's theory of film as a device to capture space. As with Parisian impressionist painters, the thing painted is not the point. It provides an origin only; the painting is about all the magical things that happen in the space between the subject and the viewers eye. The paintings, and Kurosawa's films are about that space.Kurosawa invented the technique of shooting from very far away with a telephoto so as to flatten space, and at the same time creating (usually three) layers of space. Often, he would engage the space directly.This masterful film is obsessive about the point and may be the most lush swim in dimensional space you are likely to find with the technology we have. Every shot is oriented around not the action, but the space that contains the action. Falling water, dust, lots of blown fabric and hair, feathers, arrows, even book tablets and those leaves! With lots of bamboo screens, all these are used to show the space, plus the usual fantastic mountains, clouds and forests - even at the end the Great Wall and of course the moving waves of soldiers and courtiers.Many of the architectural shots are lifted from Welles' ""Othello.""The matter is not lost in the copious allusions to mental space: the game of Go, music, calligraphy, politics, and love. All these are defined, exercised and conflated with one another in terms of space and the intrigue of space with a little more effort in the latter items on the list. Then, waving lamps are used to make 'murderous intent' spatial.Unlike 'Crouching Tiger' which this resembles not at all, the camera is static, not dancing. Where Lee emphasized the ballet of the fight by engaging his camera, Zhang stands back in the space. Where Lee conceives fights not among the participants but their masters, Zhang shows us not the fights, but the battles among the true worlds of the fights - the worlds of different colors.What we see could be the imaged Go game, or the imaged fight within it, or the imaged story Nameless tells, or the one the King tells and on and on with nestings of imaginations. Every nation creates their own movie to explain themselves. We in the US seem to like more militarist stuff. Except for the thuggish motive (my war for my kind of peace), we would do well to have stories about stories like this one through four layers until they reflect back on the origin. Complex story space in rich real space.If you are going to see this, you really must see 'In the Mood for Love,' which features Broken Sword and Flying Snow in something of the same relationship they have here. It is one of the best films ever made and truly spatial in a purely Chinese manner. It will completely transform your enjoyment of this.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
14,英雄,15,brandon_veracka,"""Hero"" is a visually stunning film which tells a wonderful story. It is centered around three men-a swordsman, an emperor, and a calligrapher-who are incredibly passionate and driven. All of the main characters, including the supporting female roles, are easy to relate to. Although the story is slow-paced and projects an air of calm, it has this certain sense of urgency that will never leave you feeling bored. In this way it's unlike-and maybe even the polar opposite of-every kung fu movie I've ever seen.I was told Hero was the most expensive movie China had ever made (at that time), and in this case, the money went to good use. With its superb direction, cinematography, and soundtrack, this film will certainly stick out among the typically fast-paced, action-heavy films from China. One thing that will stand out about this film is its use of color, which many of its reviewers rightfully praised. Without spoiling anything, how color is used to tell this story is both visually beautiful and psychologically intriguing. Combined with its incredible soundtrack, it will very likely have artistically-inclined viewers agape and speechless. In the very least, ""Hero"" is a feast for the senses-like a fireworks show of color and sound. At its best, it is a wonderful story about nationalism, self-examination, and love which is told in an unusually beautiful fashion.As many will tell you, if you liked ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", you're likely to enjoy this just as much-especially if you liked the quieter, more introspective scenes in that film. Because there is so little to compare it to, ""Hero"" is a difficult film to review. However, that only gives you another reason to give it a chance. And finally, it must be said that this is Jet Li at his very best."
15,英雄,16,oldgirl,"It's not often that a film's visual virtuosity has the ability to hit you right between the eyes. I'm still saying 'WOW', and this may go on for days. Every shot is a masterpiece of composition combined with fluid, stylized movements as graceful and technically precise as the strokes of a master calligrapher's brush. And the storyline is faithful to the best of the classical taoist fables. Lao Tzu and Sun Tzu breathe in every frame of this film. I was grateful as well to the film's releasers for not dubbing it into English, which would have destroyed the unity of this grand opus. A gorgeous film, absolutely stunning. If ever I teach AP English classes again, I will most certainly be using this film in my classes as perhaps the penultimate example of how filmmakers use color, composition, music, and movement to reinforce complex metaphorical and philosophical themes. Thank you, whomever talked US movie distributors into putting this into theaters."
16,英雄,17,The_Orenda,"In all honesty, Hero required a bit more patience than I thought. Tarantino wanted to present this movie to North American audiences so I thought there would have been more action, but surprise! There is much drama in Hero and the movie begins with one intention and unfolds, in a deceptively beautiful fashion, into a legend that is much larger than the characters themselves are involved! Why did it have to take so long to prove such a point?Anyway, a man who shall remain Nameless has dispatched the kingdom's three top assassins, thus easing the King's mind that he could sleep at night. But the King is curious and we see the true story and how the tale unfolds.The fights are beautiful. The battle between Snow and Moon, though lopsided, was a joy. It was art in itself. But overall, be patient. With the many changes in the story, I lost my concentration adjusting to it. But any fan of martial arts and drama must see this movie. It is that elegant."
17,英雄,18,chinhinleung,"The movie Hero has all the elements to appeal to two types of audience--some of the new Chinese middle class who are actually proud to be Chinese because of their nationalistic education and new wealth, and the sinophilles in the western world that surged in numbers post-crouching tiger hidden dragon, who either seeks thrill in Kungfu movies or in the exoticism of oriental culture/girls/customs or all of the above. As a poor student from Hongkong I do not qualify to be part of the target audience, and am quite disappointed by the filmmaker's misuse of a kickass cast, a large budget, and many interesting aspects of Chinese culture/history.There are many cool concepts that were put into the movie, but are almost always mishandled: For example, the crossbowmen scene--the interesting posture the archers use to tighten their crossbow string was actually depicted in ancient military illustrations. Yet it was immediately marred by the horrible special effects showing the arrows flying into the city--which was too much exaggerated and definitely not nicely done. The use of different monotonal color schemes for different sections of the movie is also a very cool idea, but some of the monotonous building interior are simply ugly. The custom design is extravagant but have neither originality nor historic accuracy. The Qin soldiers rather looks like they are borrowing customs from the roman infantry in the ""Gladiator"". Extolling the ""hero"" (Jet Li), who gave up the chance to kill the tyrant of Qin as he was convinced that Qin Dynasty would unite the whole China (which it did, if only for a few decades) and give the people peace (which it did not, nor was it likely the emperor's intention), director Zhang Yimou unnecessarily sings along with the political agenda of the Chinese government--to unite Taiwan with the People's Republic. The movie lauds the role of the Qin dynasty in uniting China, while ignoring the fact that Emperor Yinzheng was without doubt a tyrant--he enslaves people for his vast building projects, burnt books and buried intellectuals who disagree. Such things are of course encouraged to be forgotten in the new China, because analogous crimes are still being committed by the current government.Hero's strong nationalistic sentiment and lack of taste might not be felt by the average western film-goer seeking a good kungfu fight scene or some artsy cinematography in an oriental setting. For everybody elsethe earlier film ""the Emperor and the Assassin"" offers far superior treatment of the same story and is in every aspect (plot, customs, acting, cinematography, customs, sets--and the characters are actually human beings with emotions, not robots talking about building empires or fighting for humanity) a far better movie. Were ""hero"" mainland China's answer to Ang Lee's ""Crouching tiger"", it is a very pathetic one. Sadly, though the film hardly gets any enthusiastic response from Chinese communities inside/outside mainland china, it is still a reflection of a force in contemporary Chinese culture that is rather twisted: a tendency to de-emphasize human conditions while glorifying national greatness and material wealth."
18,英雄,19,wijaya_adi,"Many audiences, especially the western audiences have misunderstood the messages of this movie. This is not a movie about choosing tyranny for a greater cause such as peace. It is about choosing peace over revenge.In the movie, the king of Qin was close to unify the whole country and thus end the continuous wars. The assassins all have grudge against the king. But they realized that if they kill the king, the whole nations will plunge into another endless wars. Killing the king won't give them back what they have lost. But it will surely cause more suffering to the people. So they choose to let go their revenge and even their lives for a greater cause, the peace. It is like what the nameless said in the movie, the ideal warrior will know when to lay down the sword."
19,英雄,20,cnycitylady,"Now I'm not as into foreign films as I should be, and this one really makes me ashamed of not paying more attention to them. The story-telling in this movie is so vivid and poetic that you cannot help but love every single second of every single story that is told. The Character Sky represents strategy and cunning, Broken Sword represents rationale and understanding whereas Flying Snow is hatred and revenge. Nameless (Jet Li) encounters all of these characters and embodies all of their aspects.The color schemes used are incandescent and only help to propel the viewers into the tales that these warriors are telling the audience and each other. With one story you get white, another red, green, blue. They set the mood and get you the viewer anxious to know what this story will say. The way that each story is presented (although some untrue) builds the characters up in a way that you see that there is more to them than their basic diagnostic. You really see this exampled with Flying Snow, as she is shown as wanton, loving, vengeful and true. In the end you really need all of the stories to understand every character fully.The director of this movie did an outstanding job. This movie has great editing and direction, it is very clean and precise, never losing the attention of the audience.If you don't like foreign movies this movie will change your mind to appreciate them, and if you already like them then this will jump to the top of your list of favorites. Brilliantly done 9/10"
20,英雄,21,K_Whymark,"Visually this is a beautiful movie, however at it's heart it feels like propaganda meant to explain why it is okay that the Chinese government massacred the students at Tiananmen Square, why it's okay if they may attack Taiwan to unify the country and why Tibet must be occupied: it's for the greater good. So when you see the scene where the defenseless calligraphy students are killed by the King of Qin, remember he didn't want to do it, he just doing it for the good of China 'Our Nation' (a phrase coined by Mao Tse Tung and force down the throats of his subjects). The suffering or death of individuals doesn't matter as long as the greater good of the masses is served. It carefully promotes the ""One China"" myth invented by the government to explain China's expansion and absorption of places like Tibet.It's really part of China see? Just like so much of Europe was *really* part of Germany...Speaking of Germany: This movie is on par with the worst propaganda the Nazi's created. I can only hope that people who are drawn in by the great cast, or beautiful cinematography are not so fooled that they let the evil propaganda at the end of the movie to sneak into their brains. I can see now how Joseph Goebbels (Nazi Propaganda Minister) was able to fool so many educated people. You just shroud your evil argument with beautiful images so that the victims swallow it whole. I don't discourage you from seeing the movie, just don't be afraid to talk about what it really is about."
21,英雄,22,mungo39,"I've read a couple of the other reviews of this movie, and it looks to me as though most are written by real enthusiasts of the genre. Personally, I have seen Crouching tiger, and that's about the size of it, so I can genuinely say that this film came as a real shock to me in almost every aspect! The most obvious thing about the film is the way in which it is shot. The scenes themselves are astonishingly beautiful, deeply affecting and (I would guess) just as important as the action that they contain. The scenes engaged me in the same way that great art engages. I wanted to keep looking at them, enjoying the visual perfection.Against this perfect background the fight scenes are dreamlike, and beautifully choreographed. They highlight the fantastic art of the fighters, and reinforce the link between the understanding of form in combat, and form in calligraphy or art.The simple, beautiful nature of the combat, the colours, the scenes, and even the names of the assassins serve to underline the simplicity of the story, and reinforce its powerful (if controversial) message. The assassin becomes a hero by understanding that the creation of 'Our Land' is superior to his own revenge, and the chaos that would be created by that revenge.The conclusion that the greater good of society should supersede the individual's selfish goals probably has more resonance in China than it does in the West, but the point is made powerfully, but above all, beautifully made.Well worth watching!"
22,英雄,23,damien-16,"I think Zhang Yimou is at all times an excellent cinematographer and often a very good director, but the director stayed at home when making Hero.  Oh, the images are stunning, but also totally artificial.  They serve no other purpose than to illustrate how brilliantly he can use colour and composition.  There is no content. Everything in this film has been done before: the subject (The emperor and the assassin, by Chen Kaige), the plot (starting with Rashomon, evidently), the use of colours (un homme et une femme, for instance), music as counterpoint to a duel (Sergio Leone, most notably in Once upon a time in the West) and of course the idea to make a Chinese Martial Arts film accessible to western audiences (move over, CTHD, or at least, that was the idea).  Whereas CTHD had likeable characters whom you could relate to, an interesting plot, emotional development, a very charming performance by Zhang Zi Yi and on top of that beautiful landscapes superbly photographed and rousing fights (especially the one between Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Zi Yi in the courtyard), Hero only has the stunning images.  It's like a coffeetable book.  Two-dimensional.  Zhang Yimou gets out his whole box of tricks, but that's what we see, tricks.  We don't get emotionally involved.  Always you can see the artifice behind it all, and this idea of: look at me, see what a genius I am.  Beauty that's that pretentious leaves a bad aftertaste."
23,英雄,24,Roger_Guo,"As a native Chinese, I can not accept this kind of idea that some people must die for a 'better world'. I said 'better world' because it is a lie that Chinese people have been indoctrinated for thousand years! I guess most western audience may don't know Qin Shihuang(means the first emperor), the king in this film is the most notorious tyrant in ancient China. The Tianxia(Chinese word was spoken by the king, means 'the land and the people') spoken from his mouth is totally lie. From then on, one after another, all the king in ancient china spoke the same thing but very few of them did as what they said.Another fact is, Qin Shihuang's empire only lasted about twenty years before it was destroyed by people.Well, I do like the beautiful scenes of this movie, but it can not make me accept the idea that people should die for a tyrant."
24,英雄,25,potteries,"There are things that people must understand when we look at a film like this - the historical background and its significance in its current political and cultural settings.So first thing first - who is the King of Qin (later the Qin Emperor)? He was (and still is) a highly controversial character from over two thousands years ago, who is notable for unifying China but also someone vilified throughout Chinese history for his cruelty and brutality in the pursuit of his objective. He can be regarded as a the founder of the country called China (the English word ""China"" is often thought to be derived from the word ""Qin""), but the dynasty he founded collapsed rapidly after his death due to widespread civil revolt as a result of the hatred for his regime.What is his significance at present time in China? The Qin Emperor was hated throughout much of Chinese history, but attempts were made to rehabilitate his reputation in recent times, most notably by Chairman Mao during the 1970's. To the Chinese, historical justification of a political regime is important; and Mao, before his death, was concerned about his reputation after his death and made a conscious attempt to justify his totalitarian and brutal regime. Thus the Qin Emperor was praised for the destruction of division in favour of unification (note that this is the point made by the film), and that his brutality was justified as necessary in difficult times. In fact the criticism of him was that he wasn't ""totalitaran"" enough, perhaps in retrospect that is something that Mao was able to outdo the Qin Emperor. This image of the good dictatorship despite the great evils done is one that the current inheritor of Mao's China is keen to maintain.The Qin Emperor is therefore not just an interesting historical figure, but someone who embodies the mindset of the ruling elite of present day China. And we can therefore understand this film in term of the political and cultural context of the current regime in China (the film has the full approval of the Government of PR China). It tells us that division means violence (therefore there can be no independent Tibet or Taiwan), and to ensure peace there has to be single dictatorship and state violence is necessary, furthermore individuals must be prepared to sacrifice themselves to achieve such end.The easiest way for non-Chinese to understand this is to imagine of something that never happened - the unification of Europe by Nazi Germany (this is not an unreasonable comparison as the Qin Emperor had in China before Mao's revisionism about the same reputation as Hitler). To ensure peace in Europe, you should argue that there must be no separate nation states in Europe, and brutality is necessary to ensure peace. Peace is the be all and end all, even if as can see that in fact there has been relative peace in Western Europe after the Second World War with the separate nation states still intact.And from this we can see from this how creepy some of the reviewers are. One guy from Germany argued that we should forget about the politics and just concentrate on the beauty of the film. Just imagine saying that about Leni Riefenstahl's ""Triumph des Willens"", strange that it should come from a German. One guy argued that it is about peace, and unification is necessary to ensure it. But we can see that this is a completely bogus argument when we look at history (unified Qin collapsed in violence quickly, while Europe remains in relative peace as separate nation states). One guy from the US argued that, unlike the self-centredness of Western culture, people in Chinese expect to make sacrifice for the greater good. Well, tell that to the Chinese people living in US that they should be prepared to sacrifice their human rights for the good of the US government and see how far you will get.Other reviewers stated that the film is not totally sympathetic to the Qin Emperor as it showed him losing control (he cannot pardon Nameless, and must execute Nameless because his bureaucrats think he must). This makes the message of the film even worse - you should sacrifice your life for a totalitarian state effectively ruled by faceless and heartless bureaucrats? I can't imagine anything worse.It is, in all, a creepy film with a creepy message, supported by some creepy reviewers. Sad to see this listed among the top 250 films in IMDb."
25,捉妖记,1,quincytheodore,"Chinese animation has been through a rough time, it missed the mark so many times when used to create epic legend. However, it seems that the eccentric animation just found its niche with the blend of humor, drama and action fantasy that is Monster Hunt. It shockingly deals with a few eerie themes yet presented in family friendly light humorous way, almost like MIB in ancient China.In a world where monster and human live in inharmonious way, an ordinary man finds himself in a struggle between the monster kingdom and human hunters. It opens up with typical fantasy troupe, then escalates with good comedic tone as well as healthy dose of martial art stunts. The cast works fine, especially with famous names as supporting characters or cameos, some of them are added for comedy relief.The tone might feel awkward, it's often playful but then it displays incredibly creepy prejudice against the monster, even down to eating and torturing them. Granted, some of them look like radish or salad, although the abrupt change of pace can be startling. There are definitely some odd twists here. Fortunately enough, the core drama is light humor, with endearing family value thrown into the mix. It mostly deals with platonic funny theme, and fans of Chinese cinema should find the humor familiar.For a movie that uses animation and action choreography at the same time, Monster Hunt looks amazing, especially in the second half with gorgeous setting. It's one of the best animations Chinese has produced, it's much smoother than the rest and these silly designs are well integrated into the world. The feel of uncanny valley actually works in their favor since the monsters only partially resemble human yet they look harmless enough to be friendly.Monster Hunt has all the elements of Chinese fantasy movie, the visual effect and also the soundtracks enhance the flamboyantly cheesy premise. It's a well-produced action comedy and definitely a crowd pleaser."
26,捉妖记,2,rongrudy,"The Chinese local film ""protection week"" has been heavily criticized by Hollywood, especially when, the Universal's recent hit, Jurassic Park's run was cut short with gas in the tank. However, this year's protection week finally accomplished something. It gave birth to the top- grossing Chinese film in history – Monster Hunt. The fantasy comedy film that led by, ""Shrek""'s creator，Raman Hui sets the new Chinese box office record this week. The movie's production was a huge adventure, itself, with no predecessor Chinese film containing heavy interactions between CGI characters and real actors. It has been generally considered as too risky, considering the comparably big budget and the government's potential intervention. A typical Chinese college love- story film, the genre that dominated the market in the past six months, costs less than one tenth of Monster Hunt's investment. According to the record, our government had not been a big fan of imaginative characters, which can stop the expensive project from going on to the screens. The creative ideas in Monster Hunt, such as the promotion of harmony between monsters and humans, are unorthodox, which could be raised to a political level. However, the producer, Bill Kong -- the producer of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, still wants to take the bet. As a kid, he was a fanatic gambler on horse racing and card games. Later as a movie producer, he gambled on high budget movies and won numerous awards along with billions of dollars. He believes that the market is finally ready for partly animated, largely live-action films and the Chinese visual effect teams are mature enough to make an attractive one. Besides the production method, Monster Hunter is also one of the few movie franchises that were one hundred percent originally created by the production company in China and could be expanded to a collection of movies, books, and TV episodes. It was made to be a commercial movie, but its creative original content and the production team's accurate understanding of the market's favor end up fulfilling the interest of a wide range of Chinese audiences, which won them the praises that exceeds anyone's expectation. The movie begins with a cartoon that mimics the style of wall painting in the era of cave men combining with an unidentified narrator's voice that sounds mysterious and antique. Through the prologue, we understand that the story sets in a world where humans and monsters co-exist, but humans got tired of this and started a war driving the monsters into the far reaches of the mountains. The story's background is familiar to the audiences, since the similar backgrounds were portrayed in Chinese classics ""Shan Hai Jin"" and ""Liao Zhai Zhi Yi"". Instead of shouting out the theme of comedy, the movie gives a sense of ""Lord of the Ring"" or ""Harry Porter"". However, the mood of a thriller was broken when the camera zooms in on the adorable image of the monster queen and her chubby tummy. When the reckless evil monster revolutionaries try to overthrow the royalty, the queen flees to the land of humans and impregnates a human man with Huba, the cute monster baby. They started an adventure together to escape the capture. I can hear the audiences' hearts melting, when they go AWW during the scene that the radish looking Huba opens his eyes as a lovely baby monster. The casting was another factor that contributes to the success. The movie was originally finished in 2014. However, the protagonist, Kai Ko, was arrested for using marijuana before the movie's release. The movie was banned with his involvement. However, the producer, Bill Kong, still believes that Monster Hunt has to be finished. He invested another $15 million to retake the parts of Kai Ko, which basically is 40% of the movie. Many famous actors and actresses admired Kai Ko's persistence and offered to be guest actors. The movie ended up with an all-star team that covers fans' age group ranging from 15 to the 50s. Monster Hunt is a new break through in the Chinese Movie industry. Creativity is Chinese movie industries' future. We are glad that the protecting good monster's theme was not banned, that Raman Hui found an investor that was persistent and visionary, and that the new attempt of comedy fantasy was widely accepted."
27,捉妖记,3,lasttimeisaw,"MONSTER HUNT has broken the all-time box office record in the booming domestic market, and officially it is the highest-grossing film in China, with an estimate $391.2 million. So it really piques my curiosity and decided to give it a try (since I rarely watch Chinese films nowadays).Flagrantly branded as a film made by ""the father of Shrek"", which the slogan is blatantly printed in all its posters, its director Raman Hui is just a supervising animator of SHREK (2001, 7/10) and SHREK 2 (2004, 7/10), and the co-director of the substandard SHREK 3 (2007, 6/10), so I assume Dreamworks might have the right to sue the overblown statement.Probing into the film itself, one possibly finds it is a cringe-worthy journey from the very start, thanks to the kids-friendly creations of the monsters by the so-called ""the father of Shrek"", 2- dimensional and cartoonish in the worst way, which betrays its overt ambition to exploit the lowest common denominator at its maximum. The storyline fictionalises a world where humans and monsters (who can hide among men with a human skin) co-exist in ancient China, after an internal war between monsters, the pregnant monster queen lams with two protectors Zhu Gao and Pang Ying (whose human shapes are played by Tsang and Ng). And our hero is a young cripple Tianyin (Jing), living with his lunatic grandmother (Jin) in a remote village. He chances upon a monster hunt Xiaolan (Bai), and farcically becomes pregnant with the monster baby from the dying queen.This role-switch between man and woman might turn out to be the most recommendable part in the story, after giving birth to the baby monster, later named as Huba, a surrogate nuclear family is formed, while Xiaolan takes on the tough father's role and the limp Tianyin becomes the protective mother. Then the narrative navigates inevitably to a predictable standard mainstream product, Huba's life is hanging by a thread (with an uncomfortable reference of Chinese people's non-selective culinary fetish) and a final battle between the good and the evil, with a stiff twist doesn't make any sense for the villain's motivation, it is par for the course Tianyin have to progress into a valiant monster slayer (bad monsters only), conforms to the traditional value of preserve a man's dignity, despite it is Xiaolan who is the real heroine in the whole escapade and Bai is the best thing among the cast, the most bankable Chinese actress presently.Trying to blend as many genres as possible, action, comedy, fantasy, romance, even musical (it is utterly mortifying to watch the tasteless and jejune music numbers jammed into the story), in addition with a cast complemented with a string of household names with special appearances, namely Wei Tang, Chen Yao and Ni Yan, along with child stars from a topical reality TV show, MONSTER HUNT is meticulously calculated to its core, in order to cash in on viewers' attraction, but at the expense of dumbing down the story to a frag-mental absurdity. But a dispiriting truth is that this picture IS the record-holder, bearing that in mind, one must wail for the future of Chinese cinema rooted deeply in the unhealthy soil, and one day, hope not too late, this seemingly prosperous bubble will burst and a wake-up call is imminent, but right now, undeniably it is rather difficult to be a true cinephile in China."
28,捉妖记,4,harry_tk_yung,"If I have one compliant about this movie, it is the misleading title, specifically the use of the word ""monster"". Right at the beginning, voice-over narration spares no pain in making the point that members of this other race, regardless of how strange they may look, are in every way human's equal. Just like humans, there are good guys and bad guy, and that is all there is to it. And yet, using the word ""monster"" to denote them completely sabotages the all-too-obvious subtext of racial harmony. Why can't a special, neutral-sounding name be invented? Laziness? The guess I would venture is marketing considerations.Despite the big opening about conspiracy and power conflict at high places in the monster's realm, the plot line surprisingly oozes domesticity. There is no colossal clash of two kingdoms/races as you might be led to expect at the beginning. This is how it works. The obviously pregnant queen in the monster kingdom finds herself on the losing side of a power struggle and escapes into the forbidden human kingdom, hotly pursued by her enemies from back home. We never see the monster kingdom again as the story takes on a culinary flavor. A monster baby of royal lineage, you see, is considered by humans to be multi-star Michelin fare. While there is no lacking in Asian movie stars, many in various degrees of cameos (including lovely TANG Wei), the story is essentially about a guy and a girl who kind of adopt the new born royal monster Bupa (name given only at the end of the movie). The girl is actually a professional bounty monster-hunter with a profit motive. Eventually, they end up saving him from the fate of being the ultimate highlight of a lavish ""monster feast"". The little twist is that Bupa is physically born by the innocent nerdish guy, having been implanted into him by the dying pregnant monster mother. The girl eventually gets emotionally attached to the guy and the monster baby, in that order.The two leads beautifully deliver their scenes with both outlandish tomfoolery and subtle nuances. BAI Baihe, arguably China's current princess of rom-com, is in equal measures coquettish and cocky, a sheer delight. JING Boran is about the most lovable nerd you can find today for any Asian cast. There are exciting action sequences aplenty, offered up by a pageantry of celebrity stars, with superbly delivered animation blending so seamlessly that sometimes you totally forget that you are watching animation.While not a major part of the movie, the background music contributes. In particular, the songs, whether a tender love duet, an uplifting spirit-raiser or outright comedy, are pitch-perfect (no pun intended), enhancing the moods of the movie at just the right moments. There is a good reason for this success: they came from the pens of a pair that can deservedly be called Hong Kong's Lerner and Lowe (or Rodgers and Hammerstein, if you prefer), Leon Ko and Chris Shum."
29,捉妖记,5,paul_haakonsen,"""Monster Hunt"" (aka ""Zhuo yao ji"") was sort of a movie that was entertaining in a strange way, especially since it was a combination of animation and live action. Normally that mixture does work well enough, but it was the odd cute and cuddly appearance of the monsters in the movie that just made it weird.The story in ""Monster Hunt"" was actually surprisingly good, as it is a story which is suitable for both children and adults alike. And the movie itself is also suitable for children to watch.""Monster Hunt"" is about ancient China where humans and monsters live simultaneously, although the monsters are banished. The queen of the monster world is pregnant, but is being chased relentlessly. With her dying breath she passes on her egg to a human named Song Tianyin (played by Boran Jing). He is traveling with monster hunter Huo Xiaolan (played by Baihe Bai) and they are being chased by monster hunters set out to capture the royal monster child.With a captivating story, then ""Monster Hunt"" is already well on the way for being a good movie. But it is really helped along by some great acting performances by Huo Xiaolan, Boran Jing, Wu Jiang, Sandra Kwan Yue Ng and Eric Tsang. And it was a nice treat to have the talented Wei Tang make a short appearance in this movie.The CGI were good, although the design of the monsters was at first somewhat of a difficult pill to swallow for me. They were simply just too cute in their design to be taken seriously. So I guess you will either outright fall in love with them right away (which my wife did), or you will have problems with taking them seriously (as I did).""Monster Hunt"" is a fast-paced movie that has both a good storyline, but also has enough action and martial arts to keep the average fan of the Asian cinema more than happy.While it is somewhat of an offbeat movie, compared to the myriad of Hong Kong movies released every year, then ""Monster Hunt"" certainly is well-worth watching. It turned out to be a very nice surprise and a very entertaining movie, and I can warmly recommend this movie, both if you are a fan of the Asian cinema, but also if you are looking for a good movie for the entire family.""Monster Hunt"" scores a rock-solid seven out of ten stars rating from me."
30,捉妖记,6,Wizard-8,"I wanted to see this movie for quite some time after hearing that it was a smash hit in its native China; I wanted to see what regular Chinese people found so appealing. After seeing it, in some ways I am at a loss for words. The movie is a fantasy comedy, though both the fantasy and the comedy will seem very strange to most westerners. The fantasy portions are unlike anything in Hollywood movies, and they sometimes seem to depend on viewers having an extensive knowledge of ancient Chinese culture; if you don't have that, you'll probably be lost at times, like I was. And the humor is far from subtle, much of it being extreme slapstick that westerns might find extremely excessive. But the movie is so different in these two regards, that I was always interested to see what was coming next, since I had never seen a movie like this before. This is definitely not a boring movie. And the movie looks extremely polished for the most part, though the CGI is a bit too cartoony at times.... though this might have been intentional, to give the movie a goofy feel. While I think that many casual western moviegoers might find the whole package a bit bewildering, viewers who want something different and fun will probably find this an amusing diversion."
31,捉妖记,7,siderite,"There is one scene that makes the whole movie worthwhile, when they say goodbye. It has such an Asian feel to it: it's all heartbreaking but inevitable.Other than that, it goes from weird kung-fu action against cuddly 3D animated monsters to fart jokes, birth jokes, marriage jokes and family problems, then back again so fast that you don't really know what you're supposed to be watching. And occasionally they just randomly start singing, fortunately not too often.The story follows a hapless young man and a young female ""monster hunter"" in the context of a monster hunt. On orders from a very powerful man, all hunters are on the lookout for the monster queen and then her infant offspring. These are all very powerful kung-fu masters, but somehow they get thwarted by the power of youth and love and after much adventure and a twist, a happy ending.My conclusion is that this film combines a lot of classic Chinese concepts: the humor, the fighting style, the overlaying culture of it all. My guess is that it was aimed at young Asian children and, while it will probably be enjoyed by children everywhere, Western adults might find it crass and infantile."
32,捉妖记,8,adam_uppal,"As someone who often enjoys Chinese movies, and lives in China, I thought I would be able to appreciate this film. I was wrong.This movie is somehow boring, sappy and stupid at the same time. The plot is inconsistent, the characters are flat, and the baby monster is simply annoying.While the movie makes an attempt to include a blossoming romance, again everything is inconsistent and often ridiculous.More often than not, I found myself getting upset at how terrible the writing was. I would not recommend this movie for anybody older than five. Forget that. I would not recommend this movie to anybody at all."
33,捉妖记,9,komodovaranku,"This movie is sometimes serious. Sometimes action. Sometimes outright hilarious. Sometimes even a musical, for absolutely no reason. This movie tries to hit every genre, and fails pretty much at doing so, and instead leaves the critical viewer with a confused and forgettable impression.The story is simple. Man meets woman meets monster. Then there's some in-your-face standard romance, an evil protagonist and a sword. That about seems to be it. Oh, and the man inexplicably becomes pregnant with a monster. But not really in a woman-empowering way, but more like in a he-has-a-fat-tummy way. And this inexplicable event carries most of the narrative.Then there's the animation. There's nothing wrong with it, per se. Thankfully, it doesn't look like sock puppets, but it doesn't fit into the traditional Chinese narrative at all. The monsters don't really add much to the story. They look like green and blue blobs with big eyes, and they don't make much sense. There's not really any explanation of why they're there, why people want to get rid of them, or anything else about them really. They're not shrouded in mystery for the viewer to figure out. They're just there. Let's not forget that ""monster"" is half of the movie's title. All in all, it mostly felt like a meat-and-potatoes mass-produced Disney production shoehorned into Chinese lore. The kids will surely have a laugh, but more mature audiences (read: 5+ years) should probably look elsewhere.It should be mentioned that this is a milestone in Chinese animation and technical prowess, as lackluster as it may be in other departments. However, since Chinese moviegoers also have access to Transformers, Avengers and other blockbusters, it makes Monster Hunt seem lackluster in the technical department as well, and the only thing that seems to keep this movie afloat is some sort of patriotism for homegrown material. It can't possibly be because of the Chinese people's genuine appreciation of such a terrible flick, can it? For the sake of China's future entertainment industry, I hope not."
34,捉妖记,10,DareDevilKid,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.8/5 starsWhat makes ""Monster Hunt"" so appealing is its easily digestible story arc, refreshingly devoid of Confucian morality, educational historical background or nationalistic grandstanding — in short, everything that makes most Chinese children's films such a yawn. Stylistically, the film blends Western demon-slaying elements, Japanese yokai folklore, and even a distant echo of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" into a fanciful Chinese setting, beefing it up with robust martial arts action with an eye toward holding the attention of adult viewers.In ""Monster Hunt"" the protagonists are greenish ogres with mushy hearts — not surprisingly, since this jolly live-action/animated Chinese period fantasy is helmed by Raman Hui, the Hong Kong-born animation supervisor who was involved with the genesis of the ""Shrek"" franchise. The toon creatures are the real stars in this zippy, technically accomplished entertainer, which has become the highest-grossing Chinese film of all time.Jing, who has so far been a sturdy foil for showier leads like Eddie Peng in ""Rise of the Legend"" or Huang Xiaoming in ""The Guillotines,"" trudges along with little charisma in the earlier scenes, but perks up as soon as Bai arrives on the scene. With her pixie-like charm, Bai is the spark that fuels their larky courtship. However, the narrative is at times bogged down by celebrity comedians and A-list stars jostling for attention in what are essentially glorified cameo appearances.The film is supposedly inspired by ""Classic of Mountains and Seas"" (""Shan Hai Jing""), a 206 B.C. Chinese tome in which the monsters look like blowfish that have swallowed dinosaurs. But Director Hui's artistic input no doubt helped inspire a creature-design aesthetic that's recognizably Asian, yet spunkier and less parochial than most Chinese animation, with their slavish reproductions of classical Chinese templates. Thanks to high-caliber visual effects — supervised by Jason Snell (the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series, ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"", ""Elysium"", and ""Tomorrowland""), among others — the interaction between the animated and live-action characters is seamless, as are the monsters' dramatic transformations. Yohei Taneda's production design blends ethereal inkbrush landscapes with period sets that range from mundane to spectacular. The tussles between humans are choreographed by Ku Huen-chiu with snappy, cartoonish timing, but remain bound by Hong Kong high-wire stunt conventions.Raman Hui does a perfectly competent job of keeping things together, and his experience in Hollywood working for DreamWorks, including co-directing ""Shrek the Third"", does give the film somewhat of an east meets west feel that differentiates it from other recent Chinese fantasies. It's certainly easy to see why the film went down so well with local audiences, though thanks to a lack of the usual flag waving patriotism and a focus on universal themes of family and community, there's nothing here to make it inaccessible to those in other countries around the world.The film's status as a genuine home-grown blockbuster is cemented through some excellent production values and heartwarming character designs, with some top notch special effects, sets and costumes making it visually impressive from start to finish. There's really a great deal to like about ""Monster Hunt"", and it should have a much wider appeal than most other fantasy or family films from Asia. An important benchmark of sorts as a smash hit Chinese blockbuster made primarily for Chinese audiences, it's well-deserving of its success, and hopefully the inevitable sequels will attain the same level of highly enjoyable tomfoolery.Chinese blockbuster"

36,捉妖记,12,billygoat1071,"Monster Hunt begins telling the history of the war between mankind and monsters, when the humans won, the monsters have separated themselves from them until years later, their queen escaped while bearing a child who will become the prince and being tracked down by other monsters and a human army. The opening doesn't bring anything fresh within its backstory, the actual plot doesn't get any less original either, when we cut to a young hero who doesn't get any luck after this plot came and other colorful set of character join to his journey. Despite of these done to death tropes and premise, the movie however brought something appealing, and that's definitely how seriously weird it is. It's packed with a lot of amusingly strange ideas which becomes its own personality. It's good if it runs less than two hours. The stock plot doesn't get any better and the climax feels a little too long for its own good. But to what it is, there is something delightful to its weirdness.So the hero lives in a small village, he lives with a relative anyone but his parents, he feels like an outcast, an underdog, etc. At this point of this film, it's just totally uninteresting witnessing the same tropes, even without trying to make its own spin out of it. And then he discovered that there is more to this world than what he has always knew. There is a girl who is stronger than him... is this even worth paraphrasing? You get the bottom line, however, the film gets better when it shifts to being downright weird. The pregnant queen can transfer her egg to another womb, which is given to the male hero. And this little antic is actually quite amusing. After the laboring, the movie continues to play off the concept as they raise this little monster. It's a delight, but it still doesn't help the plot that much.Even before the climax comes, it's still felt uncertain where the story is going. It feels a little busy playing around to some of its side villains. Now when it comes to the actual climax, it would have gone better if it was shorter than it was. And then a twist reveals that is kind of generic. There just isn't much to it, the story between the relationship of the monsters and humans remain thin. It's the main characters and the baby prince is the only strong moments in here.And to be fair, before the climax that eventually wears off, the pacing is kind of nice, making every moment reasonably entertaining. The action scenes are watchable. The special effects are alright, though the only likable digital creature is the prince which is admittedly adorable. The performances seem to be having fun on what they're doing, bringing energy into this film's silly nature of being a cartoon.That's pretty much what Monster Hunt mostly feels like, a cartoon. Yeah, the tropes and plot are pretty stock, but it really gets more interesting when it's getting weirder and weirder, from a pregnant male protagonist to some dark sense of humor it keeps things entertaining. I sort of wished they establish more of this mythology and how this monster prince can change their world, but the movie doesn't have much of that opportunity. To what it is, it's fun, though I wish it was a little shorter, or spent those other minutes to develop the fantasy stuff. But the main characters eventually become charming, in spite of how faulty the plot is. Monster Hunt is entertaining for the outrageous stuff alone."
37,捉妖记,13,katavarhelyi,"Amongst it's genre, this movie is a very funny and well-dosed one. All the characters are perfectly written, even the animated ones. The creators found a great balance between being funny and staying touching, between the human and monster world. Made me cry, Huba is just too cute to bear. Not to mention the visual orgy of this one. I respect how the Asian filmmakers show all the impossible as possible, I mean: all the action and fun stuff in this movie is very entertaining. Definitely recommend this movie if you like it's genre. The actors are nailing it, you can relate to most of them. There is no thing such as 'too much' in Chinese movies. Emotions and fun are just as important as the action part. The reason why I gave it only an '8' is the end of the movie. I wanted something else. Left me a bit hungry."
38,捉妖记,14,CelluloidDog,"I watch animated films once in a while and I watched this right after another foreign animated film, Hero Quest (on Netflix). In contrast to the muddled, flat, at times horrific Hero Quest (probably a 3.5 rating out of 10, 4.1 on IMDb), Monster Hunt is a thoroughly enjoyable film. It fits more with the animated humor of the Dreamworks genre (more so than Pixar). Not surprisingly, Raman Hui, who worked with Shrek and other Dreamworks productions takes his energy and infuses Monster Quest into a well-done tale.Overall, it's one of the best foreign animated films but does fall a bit short of Pixar's and Dreamworks' top 10 films. So it has a bit of Monsters Inc or Shrek or How to Train Your Dragon but falls a bit short. Nevertheless, it should rank in the middle of the pack of the better CGI animated films of the last two decades. The strength of the film is actually(!) the human characters: the lead Boran Jing who plays the bumbling Tianyin. And Baihe Bai who plays Xiaolan, the Monster Hunter and Elaine Jin, the grandmother were the strengths of the film with comedic acting that's among the best anywhere. For that, the human comedy roles get a 9.5/10. And some of the gags were terrific humor such as when Tianyin plays hide-and-seek with the Wuba, the baby king, to lure him into the cage. The chemistry between Boran Jing and Baihe Bai is terrific, it rarely gets better.However, the storyline gets a bit complicated and it's easy to lose track. Then the couple songs in the film just don't really make the grade. In addition, it's hard to really warm up to the monsters except maybe the Baby King (Radish). The monsters had faceless qualities and never really developed strong characters unlike Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, or Sulley or Mike Wazowski (from Monsters Inc). The CGI was fabulous but it had some blandness. It's like looking at some really beautiful and delicious pizza but when you bite in, it does really have a great flavor. Hence, it never really pulls out the emotional connection. Still, the film is wonderful fun. It just doesn't make the top 15-20 animated film list. Yet, its uniqueness and wuxia antics make it a darling for fans of Chinese films. Hence, it deserves to be #1 in China. It's better than the 6.2 rating, surprisingly low, and should move up with time. I gave a 9 to balance the act but the real rating is 7.2-7.5."
39,捉妖记,15,subxerogravity,"So this is the highest grossing film in China Right now? Well so far it seems that my local cinema has been given me one of China's blockbusters every week. From Mojin: the lost treasure to Detective Chinatown. I like those movies so I thought a movie about hunting monsters would be a grand slam. This did not happen for me. I was not expecting a movie so catered for children, which became completely obvious the moment the cute little monsters dominated the screen. For the first ten minutes I thought I was in the wrong theater watching a CGI animated movie. Even the monsters that were suppose to be scary were too cute to be taken seriously.I also did not know how much watching the non-3D version would lesson my experience as the 2D version was in an English dubbed that seem to be paying homage to Kung fu flicks of the past with it's awfulness. It's not funny when you're doing the bad dub on purpose, and I think the whole story may have fallen out of whack because of it. The Chinese seem to be making these big budget films that can rival American blockbusters and I'm into it, just not real into Monster hunt. I found this adventure to be real boring to the point where it got painful to get through."
40,捉妖记,16,paulclaassen,"Whether you're into monsters or not, this adorable film will appeal to a wide audience. Whether you love it for the action, the stunts, the visual effects, or the cuteness of the baby character, there's something here for everyone to adore. I just loved everything about it. I found it incredibly cute and delightful and a pleasure to watch. Some scenes were jaw dropping incredible!!"

42,捉妖记,18,SnoopyStyle,"This is a Chinese film aka Monster Hunt. In ancient China, mankind had driven the monsters into the remote mountains after once living in harmony. There is a civil war within the monster world. The old king has been killed and the pregnant queen is on the run. Song Tianyin is the young mayor of a small village. His grandmother claims the family to be monster hunters. Huo Xiaolan (Bai Baihe) is a mercenary monster hunter. Song is shocked when Huo reveals two travelers to be monsters in disguise.The basic premise is good. The story structure is fine. The characters are good. The creature designs are a little creepy. The small eyes and the tentacles make them look like part monkey and part octopus. The baby's radish look is good but again the tentacles bother me. I can't see these creatures being sold as cuddly toys. I would get rid of the tentacles. There are other creepy things that happen. Whether it's the pregnant dude or eating monsters, some of this is off-putting especially in the western sense. Sure, Arnold got pregnant in Junior but it wasn't a monster and Junior wasn't actually liked. The sashimi monster is disturbing. Of course, the reference is clear. It's especially compelling since exotica animal meat trade seems to be the genesis of the recent viral outbreak. Nevertheless, the creep factor is on the high side for a family film. This is generally good but some of the absurdness gets creepy."
43,捉妖记,19,Reno-Rangan,"As far I remember I've not seen any Chinese or the Hong Kong movies in the past 12 months. So I have heard about this film a lot that it was the China's highest domestic gross movie ever. Since then I have marked it to check it out as much soon as possible and after the watching with a high expectation I'm here right away. I've been watching movies since my childhood, but it became serious after the 'The Two Towers'. So first I'm a fantasy film fan before becoming neutral. But still sometimes I'm very keen on them like I was for this one.In the present era, we've zombies, superheroes, vampires, werewolves, aliens, robots, so on varieties for making a good entertaining flick. But just half a millennium ago when there was no motion-picture, but literature and the stage play, there were only good vs bad, god vs devil, man vs monster and beasts. So the modern creations were sci- fi and the old ones are fantasies. After CGI is becoming very flexible, the filmmakers are on the race to get on-board into one of those genre franchises. So nowadays we are witnessing head-to-head contest between these two genres, but a great treat for the movie fanatics like me.The first impression was the film's posters which were done similar to the traditional Chinese paintings. Second, the decent trailer, I was displeased with the CGI characters in the clips, but watching them in the full flow movie it looked so much better. One of the best visually stunning Mandarin movies. Despite setting a record at the box office, the budget was doubled after the drug controversy over the original lead actor who was later replaced by another and re-shot his portions entirely including special effect were redone.""Monsters are the most cunning creatures in the world. They hide in human skin, dress as human and speak human language!""The director had a handful experience from working on some Hollywood projects. Literally, it was his first solo, also the first live-shot directional debut movie and he nailed it. Very disappointing when it comes to the story, because it was just a one-liner which is well known since the inception of motion-picture. Set in the ancient period China when the humans and monsters lived together and later went to the war to dominate each other. Drawn a border between the two worlds that brought peace for the centuries until one day some kind of coup happened in the monsters' side. So the confrontation restores after a few monsters hops on the other side with human. How it all will be solved is the remaining action, adventure with lots of fun.Quite similar to current European migrant crises. People who flee from the civil war in the middle-east is not welcomed by the few locals which led to some violence in the refugee camps. In this movie as well, without realising they brought the same environmental situation between man and monster.Of course it is a children-cum-adult movie, but killing the cute monsters and cooking them, all of them are kind of gave me a sceptical feeling. Besides, it had romance as a sub-plot and Baihe Bai was so cute. Usually movies from this part of the Earth reminds martial arts. Since the director worked in 'Shrek' films, easily noticeable that some contents influenced from the other industries as well. The human skin thing reminded me the MIB and the song Indian films. The comedies are the uplift along the exciting stunts which fought among the live and CGI characters.There are some thing that does not make sense, but in fantasy films those are logical that we can't consider as a flaw. But explanation needs, especially the inspired mythical story from another culture and that is where it quite failed. Overall movie passes the entertainment and quality test, but it is more a family movie and less a youngster's. Definitely a sequel is on the card after the tremendous success, if they fail to bring another movie, it will be their loss. For the foreign audience, especially the western world, it might be an average or an okay movie because of quite familiar with this kind of theme. Anyway, I recommend it for those who enjoy comedy-fantasy films.7½/10"
44,捉妖记,20,imim123,"It is exciting to finally watch a domestic Chinese animated film. ""Monster Hunt"" is a combination of advanced animated technology with Chinese Culture such as Kung fu, ancient Chinese myth and magic. ""Yao"", nickname for mystery monsters in China, owns a long history since ancient time and plays an important role in traditional Chinese mythology. Compared to Hollywood Animation Films, although ""Monster Hunt"" is by no means any superior with some obvious shortcomings such as loosely written script and insufficient character modeling, it marks a brand-new start for Chinese animation industry. In fact, it already stands out in all the Chinese movies that was released this summer and it is also well-received in the market with a total box-office revenues of 2.44 billion. According to the plot, a lot more stories can be developed with regard to ""Huba"", the main animated character, it remains a pretty good chance that there will be a sequel to this film. The audience will be curious about what will happen to ""Huba"", the main animated character after it departed its father ""Song Tianyin"", what will become of Song Tianyin since he decided to be a professional monster hunter. Some will also wonder what Song Tianyin's father is like since he is repeatedly mentioned in the film but never actually showed up. I think everything will be explained in the sequel.Although ""Monster Hunt"" is pretty good compared to certain standards, the overall Chinese domestic films are still primitive, and excellent projects are scarce in number and low in quality. Only a couple of high quality films can be produced due to China's strict censorship policy. It has a long way to go for Chinese domestic film industry, but we shouldn't give up our hope. Roma is built in one day, I believe positive changes will happen to Chinese domestic film industry in the near future."
45,捉妖记,21,yoggwork,"The special effects are quite good and the pictures are beautiful. Unfortunately, the plot is too retarded and the performance is exaggerated. If it weren't for the national film protection month, how much would the box office be left?"
46,捉妖记,22,dafrosts,"The movie starts with explaining how Monsters and Humans once lived together but things soured and Humans and Monsters split to live apart. Monsters that escaped back into the Human realm were captured by the Monster Hunters and forced to live as disguised Humans or suffer a far worse fate.Tianyin is the mayor of a small village, where no one respects him, especially his grandma who has some serious short term memory issues. His life changes when he encounters Monster (disguised as humans)on the run from Monster Hunters. He is marked by The Queen of the Monsters and held as bait by one of the Hunters so she can capture the Queen and get the reward. Things don't go as planned and The Queen dies after making Song her surrogate to ensure the Prince of Monsters will be born.Tianyin's pregnancy is short lived - I'm sure he's thankful for that. He does have quite the appetite for a while. Much to the chagrin of the Monster Hunter who wants to take the Prince from him and sell the baby for a profit.The animation is impressive. I like how the live action mixes with the animation. I watched it with subtitles. It is great with the actors' actual voices so you can get their emotional responses to their situations.The relationship between Tianyin, Xiaolan (The Monster Hunter who won't admit she really likes Tianyin and the Prince) and WUBA aka Prince of Monsters, gets you in the feels. Xiaolan wants to focus on WUBA simply being a Monster while Tianyin sees him as a child in need of parenting.Problems rise as the trio make their way to the City. They are confronted by higher ranking Monster Hunters who want WUBA for the reward. Monsters are also looking for WUBA, for their own reasons.This is a movie along the lines of Shrek, in that it has double entendres all through it. The Kung Fu is mixed with magic, so there's a bit more of the theatrics to it. Even the monsters get in on the Kung Fu fights. The best fights occur during the grand dinner.The journey reveals some truths about Tianyin's family that have him rethinking life with WUBA in it. This movie doesn't hesitate to have you laughing with Tianyin one moment an feeling sad for him the next. I like movies that can drag you in so deep.When Tianyin's true heritage is revealed, he has to let WUBA go to protect him. It's a heart wrenching moment. Poor WUBA doesn't understand since he's only a child. Tianyin knows WUBA will be safe with other Monsters to protect him.I cannot wait for Monster Hunt 2 in February, 2018. I am hoping for a happy reunion between WUBA and his Human dad. I give it a 9 because it's just one of those movies that keeps you involved from the the beginning to the final credits."
47,捉妖记,23,Trupiaar,"So I really enjoyed this movie. It was cute, funny, and just pretty much off the wall. Weird stuff went down, but again, just kept enjoying many of the moments from this.I was wondering a little bit about what was up with some of the editing, but a helpful reviewer above said something essentially about the main star being replaced, and a lot of scenes having to be re-shot without him(Politics in China thing). Everything pretty much made sense after that. Glad producer decided to stick with it and finished the movie, because it still came out pretty cool.I will definitely show this to my nephew in a couple years, it will be cool to watch it with him.Also, I'm normally super picky in my reviews, and normally a basher, so I feel like making me happy with the movie is fairly impressive. Enjoy!"
48,捉妖记,24,theoryladeness,"To offset reviews that seem lacking in full appreciation of all of the qualities of this movie, I should probably give this movie a 10, but I recognize my own bias towards the film genre. Anyone with similar film taste might really enjoy this movie. The casting, acting, scene design, and writing were synergistic and the film is full of beautiful imagery and CGI.What I appreciated the most, however, was the socio-cultural critique of animal abuse, factory farming and eating other creatures. There is no explicit philosophy set forth, but only the real emotions that result from having to care for something so similar to a human. As the main character remarks, ""There are good monsters and bad monsters"", but the most satisfying parts of the movie are when the characters experience a deep compassion for the monsters (and vice versa) that transforms their behavior. Of course there is a love story with familiar themes, but by avoiding too many clichés and giving gender role reversal center stage, the two characters that fall in love offer convincing performances that make an otherwise fantasy setting a realistic depiction of human love, a love that we see extend to the non-human throughout the movie."
49,捉妖记,25,the_doofy,"And a kick to watch, so its no wonder mainstream hollywood has not made this gem known to us and kept it out of the spotlight---this kind of treatment is what hollywood did with baahubali"
50,哪吒之魔童降世,1,nick-caddy,"I did not originally want to watch this film as I do not like the story it is based on but I am glad I did.I am a huge fan of myths and legends of different countries and cultures and I liked the old Chinese animations.
4 years ago, they made a Monkey King animation which I loved and finding out that that team helped on the Nezha movie was one of the reasons why I chose to watch it.The core concept is about fighting fate and against how others see you.
Another point I loved about it is as it is a Chinese movie it is told from a Chinese perspective and from Chinese culture. This is great way for people to learn more Chinese people and culture. The down side is it is different to movies that we are used to and a lot will not be understood if we are not Chinese or know much about Chinese mythology. Also some of the jokes reference Stephen Chow's work.The English title ""I am the destiny"" makes sense to Chinese viewers, it is meant to be artistic with deep meanings (I spent a day discussing the title with my wife who is Chinese, she was explaining why she understood this title while it would not have been her first choice). Think of it as ""I make my own fate"" or if they just chose ""Nezha: Fate""The animation is amazing, the difference between the characters (humans, animals, clouds) and the scenery is marvellous. I wished to look at more of the buildings but that's just me being weird.The music is great. Very exciting and also a lot using traditional Chinese instruments (one part is a tribute to the Terminator movies with traditional Chinese instruments) also the credits music is a great song they made for the moive with a lot of great lyrics (in Chinese)The action scenes are beautifully made and flow very well. Also the pacing of the movie is perfect, at no point did I feel they dragged a joke or a scene on for too long.The story is a retelling so some people may be annoyed that it deviating from the original but Disney does it all the time so leave them alone.
The story is interesting and the changes makes it more relatable.There are some bugs with the animation but they almost didn't finish in time for the summer holidays so I'm willing to overlook that.What's more is the director's backstory. He studied medicine in University. His animation background, all self taught. Made a 3d animation by himself and won a lot of awards. The company he works for now collected a lot of animation companies together to make this movie. They risked a lot but this movie is the director's dream which he had been thinking about for years.This can be seen in his attention to details. One of the charecters has a different accent because of where this character is from. And the director spent a lot of time to find the perfect voice actors for his characters (which I find to be a major failing of the Chinese animation industry in general, some beautiful animations ruined by frustratingly annoying voice actors)Background information you should know.
The old guy is the most powerful in heaven.
In China, a master takes disciples for training. He is like a parent, teacher and master at the same time. Choosing a master or a disciple is not entered into lightly.
At that time, monster attacks are common and many people have lost family to them.
Might need to find a Chinese friend to help explain other points you may find confusingI've seen it 7 times and I advice you to watch it on IMAX, looks better.I hope they get a good subtitles team, a lot of jokes will be hard to translate. I also hope that they don't dub it. The dubbed version of ""Hero is Back"" the Monkey King animation was terrible and ruined it
Also hope that they will release it in China with the English subtitles so that I have an excuse to watch it again"
51,哪吒之魔童降世,2,n-44597,It's such a spectacular movie I was totally blown away while watching it in theater. The director is a genius with extraordinary imagination and a fully grasp of animation movie making. The story is rooted from Chinese ancient myths Nezha. The fantastic adaptation couldn't have been better. It has gained mountains of positive comments in China. Desperately expect it will be watched by more and more people.
52,哪吒之魔童降世,3,jameszw-69-437016,"There have been over 10 years since I go to the theater watching the Chinese garbage movies. This one really really changed my mind. I see a glimpse of light of the Chinese animation movies, and a fire for the whole Chinese movie industry."
53,哪吒之魔童降世,4,lixuechen,"It's so great to see this movie on show in NYC theaters! The story line one the best of its kind. I didn't like the look of Nezha at first glance, but I love it very much after seeing the movie. The story is very touching and completed. Love it and strongly recommended!"
54,哪吒之魔童降世,5,libin72-50-44920,"Fantastic animation, the storyline is a little diverted from the original ancient story but just as good. I almost burst into tears several times."
55,哪吒之魔童降世,6,robert333,"After seeing the posters and trailers, my first reaction was: nezha is so ugly. Feel ugly on the right, because this film is about to break the prejudice. As a lot of people look at this is diffuse, do not see; Or to see, see feel good also want to automatically deduct 20 points. In the movie, calling nezha a monster is politically correct. In addition to the film, scold domestic films, diffuse also become political correctness, as long as you scold it, someone will give you thumb up. In fact nezha is not a monster, he also wants to fall demon in addition to the devil wash name; Not all films are bad, but some people want to make a good film to prove themselves. Like nezha. The landscape of mountains and rivers is truly unrestrained and shocking. It embodies the objects that once existed only in the imagination and shows the infinite imagination of Chinese mythology incisively and vividly. Those familiar stories are no longer just stories, but can be seen, heard and enjoyed visually. With nezha this year and jiang ziya next year, the god movie universe is about to open. It's time to introduce Chinese culture to the world."
56,哪吒之魔童降世,7,y-10380-87211,"Please watch the movie before you jump into any assumption, because this animation movie was born to challenge the concept of prejudice. With original materials from the ancient Chinese sagas, the story voiced the modern values of the Z generation instead of any of those cliches we've seen over and over again in recent movies. If you look closely, you could even find that the movie also tackled nowaday issues such as modern parenting, cyber bullying, etc. Also for example, some people even view the hero as a typical patient with bipolar disorder in terms of mental health. In conclusion, not only did the movie make great progress in animation design, but it also achieved great success in play writing, and has therefore set a great example for the Chinese animation industry."
57,哪吒之魔童降世,8,hz-548-59843,"This movie has broken record, so my expectation is quite high. And in the end it really meets my expectation. The story is well told, and it made people laugh every other minutes, but at some point it made you think about family and love, and you just cant stop crying. I enjoyed every minute of it."
58,哪吒之魔童降世,9,MarkassBrownie,"The following is not necessarily a review of the film, but a recount of my own viewing experience of this film.After months of rolling my eyes at the social media buzz about this supposedly ""great Chinese animation"", I finally found the one Regal theater in town that actually shows this movie. And I'm glad I did.Initially, I was turned off by this movie's trailer, since it had all the worst stereotypes of a Chinese-made film, with all the cheesy expositions, cringey dialogues, and awkward voice acting. I was so sure that ""Nezha"" was just another piece of garbage coming out of the money-grabbing film industry that had become so shamelessly greedy in recent years. But my low expectations were pleasantly subverted.After some struggling of finding a parking spot, I found myself in a relatively small-sized IMAX theater packed with young Chinese people, and a handful of white Americans, and one nice black lady who very much stood out in this crowd. And I'm almost certain that all of us enjoyed the two hours of fun and entertainment this film offered us, albeit on different levels.Almost immediately after the movie started playing, I found myself already irritated by the unnecessarily long opening credits of all the production companies associated with ""Nezha"". This is one of the many shady industry practices in China, where all the entities involved in the film's production process shamelessly tried to promote their brands, regardless of how much actual contribution they've made. But shortly after the actual film began to show on the screen, I was easily won over by the opening scene where the famous Daoist immortal ""Taiyi Zhenren"" was revealed to be an obese and seemingly incompetent idiot. It was a subversion of the genre trope. When it comes to the genre of Chinese mythology films, Daoist immortals were almost always portrayed as wise old men whose wisdom and authority are not to be questioned. And here in ""Nezha"", one of the most powerful and respected Daoist deities was portrayed as a buffoon who actually had real human personality.And at the same time, I was surprised to find myself actually enjoying the jokes and humors of the film, which I think is very rare in Chinese films. Even though I haven't watched any Chinese film for many years, I'm aware of the awfulness and cringiness of the typical attempts at comedy by trying to crack an awkward joke between scenes in Chinese films. But here in ""Nezha"", I enjoyed most of the comedy in it, even though I can see how goofy it is. Goofiness in film can be a good thing if it is done in the right tone.There are more turns and twists than I expected throughout the film, and I enjoyed the whole ride. However, I have to point out, there are one or two very brief moments in the film, which I didn't appreciate as much. I know the filmmakers were being serious in those brief moments, trying to evoke a certain emotion from audience. But it didn't work on me because of the voice acting in those scenes which took me right out of the film. Don't get me wrong, the voice acting was great in ""Nezha"", much better than most films. But in certain brief moments, it just didn't work for me.Now comes another possible issue of ""Nezha"", which might be an impediment to the general audience's enjoyment of this film. That is the English subtitles. I have to acknowledge that I myself could not do a better job than they did, at translating the Ancient Chinese mythological concepts into modern-day English while trying to make sense to an audience unfamiliar with Chinese culture at large. But I'd like to argue perhaps transliteration might be a better approach than imprecise translation. Also I have to point out, as with almost all foreign language films, the humors and multi-layered emotions of most dialogues in ""Nezha"" were inevitably lost in translation.Overall, ""Nezha"" was one of the best Chinese entertainment I've experienced in recent years, even though I haven't really watched that many real Chinese films. I'm glad that ""Nezha"" got a huge box office success in China which it so very much deserves. I'm not so sure ""Nezha"" would be a hit elsewhere. It might get popular to a certain degree on some streaming platforms. But I doubt it will get mainstream popularity in US, since most American media's portrayal of everything remotely related to China has been so negative lately ever since the Trade War.Anyway, for me, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Nezha"". But I don't know the experience would be the same for everyone, since you have to have a certain willingness to put up with imprecise translation while at the same time trying to be culturally open-minded.P.S. Sorry about my rambling in this long-ass review. But I can't believe I actually enjoyed a Chinese animation film so I have to take the time to write my genuine feelings about it.(Additional comments: CHINA was the nation that had once gave the world the absolutely worst garbage film series ever produced by mankind. I'm talking about, of course, the infamous ""Tiny Times"" series by the famed gay novelist Guo Jingming. Ever since my great suffering by Guo Jingming's garbage films, I had never ever given any Chinese-made films any sort of serious interest until the year 2019. At the beginning of this year, there was the surprise box office success, the ""Wandering Earth"", which I also enjoyed. And now I'm thoroughly won over by ""Nezha"". I think it's been a good year for the Chinese film-making and we shall see if it will last.)"
59,哪吒之魔童降世,10,neovaliane,"A complete and intelligent storyline, live characters, and lots lots of love. I cannot help but compare it to Wall-E, Toy Story 3, or Zootopia. It is as entertaining, touching, but also different. I can enjoy the movie fully because I am a native Chinese speaker, and I hope the translation can get the essence of the story, so more people can enjoy it. Recommend!"
60,哪吒之魔童降世,11,henryau-29344,"...from my initial impressions. Thought it would be a bomb knowing nothing about the film judging by the trailer and poster, only interested in the mythology of Ne Zha. And damn, it was entertaining, fast paced full of slapstick humor and action, although the first few minutes had some slight cringe you might expect from a Chinese animation, but that quickly goes away.The visuals and 3d were spectacular. I'd say on the level of Dreamworks, somewhat near Pixar at times, although there were moments especially the dragons that were pretty bad, and 1 or 2 scenes that made my eyes spasm a bit from weird 3d movement. I first thought the initial character designs were like some weird Naruto-esk spinoff with the child NeZha looking a bit ugly, plus tropey action scenes. But it's one of those cases where watching it is much better than the lower quality trailers I came across, and none of the action was corny with emo characters trying too hard to act cool.The subtitles can pass by VERY fast and/or get lost against the background, so get ready to read fast. I'm left with some questions on the origin story which deviates a little from what I read, but there's enough to stay true to the mythos. There are even some moving, touching scenes with NeZha and his parents. Can't wait for the sequel which multiple end credits scenes point to."
61,哪吒之魔童降世,12,williamsong-19226,"Very exotic while the aesthetic definitely wouldn't turn western audience off. Great animation, you can tell the budget is substantial, I would say that the production value is at least on par with Pixar. Surprisingly good film."
62,哪吒之魔童降世,13,lindaoyang,"This is a very good looking animated film. The various special effects are very exquisite, the language is humorous and full of emotions, but it is not in English, which is not conducive to the audience to better understand the story. The Chinese flavor of the plot is strong, and the overall feeling is still very good."
63,哪吒之魔童降世,14,kenthesweet,"I speak very little Chinese, but I saw this film with my girlfriend (native speaker) at the cinema. She helped me understand plot points and certain dialogue that I was struggling with. This film is a great step in the right direction for the Chinese 3D animation industry, but in no way is it worthy of a 10/10. This film falls drastically short of the high bar set by films like those from Pixar.The good:-The landscapes and effects are bright and beautiful-The voice acting is solid-Some of the humor works even despite the language barrierThe bad:-Most of the characters look like they're from different movies. The juxtaposition between young/transformed Nezha, his parents, the bad guy and the villagers just feels off. This film would benefit from more consistent character design.-Some of the jokes are based more on Chinese meme culture, and as all of us know in the west, using memes in films is lazy pandering and sure to age very poorly.-There are some emotional cliches regarding sacrifice and character reactions to events in the film. These things have been done a million times before and they are not exceptional here at the least.
All in all, I thought the film was decent. It was fun and looked a lot better than most 3D animation in China. But oh man are people riding the hype train on this one! It's really not a perfect or even great movie, but it is a step in the right direction. Hopefully Chinese films in the future will build off of this and produce films that are worthy of being called true classics, Chinese or worldwide."
64,哪吒之魔童降世,15,Charlotte-666,"This movie has grossed 4.1 billion yuan in China! (Don't ask me why I know) I have a Chinese nearby who flew to his hometown specially to see. She told me that it is really very nice! ! ! (Although the production cost is only 60 million RMB), many stars have imitated it on China's microblog, which shows that it is very popular!"
65,哪吒之魔童降世,16,zhu_wenzhen,"It's a cartoon based on traditional Chinese myth, but I personally think it's as deep as Zootopia, in this movie, it discusses prejudices against stereotypes and self-identity under hatred, and made me think a lot about racial and gender discrimination.""If fate isn't fair, fight it till the end."" I cried all over the second half of this movie. As a minority of being Asian and woman in male-dominated tech industry, I can totally relate."
66,哪吒之魔童降世,17,briankelp,"I just watched ""Nezha"" and it was one of my most favorite movies I have seen in the past year. The animation was extremely well made, with only a few frames where an effect was not lined up with the object, but other than that, it was amazing.The movie was able to invoke emotion within me, which is something that not even ""Infinity War"" was able to do."
67,哪吒之魔童降世,18,Stevenmengxf,"First of all, I must say it's the best Chinese movie ever! I also stress it's best from China, and based on Chinese culture. So I don't feel surprised that many westerners don't understand or like this movie. But I insist to recommend you to watch if you have interest in China or Chinese culture, of course also if you like to enjoy the good movie.
We all have our vision to the world based on different culture and religion, which makes the world colorful and splendid. So we respect the difference of each culture. As I remember, when I saw some heroical movies such as Batman, it made me sleepy. There are many other examples of this. After some years, I know more and more western cultures, I began to like some American movies, although there are still some that never could be my taste.
All in all, I just want to say, don't feel surprise many people like this movie but you don't. If you haven't watch it, I recommend you to."
68,哪吒之魔童降世,19,iChuan-6324upup,"Nothing to say, CHONG JIU WAN SHI LE ,the box office will be exceed 5 billion.CHONG CHONG CHONG"
69,哪吒之魔童降世,20,yubing-94268,Best Chinese animation ever! It makes you laugh and cry.
70,哪吒之魔童降世,21,djlljd-08405,"After the White Snake, Monkey King, now Nezha is coming as new/best one of these series.Nice job.BTW it only comes with English subtitle, and mannnnnny funny point are sadly lost by translation. But it's still worth enough to watch."
71,哪吒之魔童降世,22,ivypetal,"It has strong morals and an unpredictable plot, but some parts may come off a little too preachy and repeating."
72,哪吒之魔童降世,23,htao-14673,"The exquisite and affectionate friendship and portrayal, the bright picture, the anti-traditional surprise story, and the exciting lines. Very worthy of the whole family."
73,哪吒之魔童降世,24,westsideschl,"I can find little fault in this production, and especially surprising how open & diverse the characters were for coming out of China. Storytelling was intelligent, sardonic, humorous, poignant. English voicing, often shaky in Asian films, was quite modern Western & culturally appropriate. Above all, the animation quality was nearly as good as it gets lacking only in individualized detail, but I didn't really miss it (e.g. in animals/humans the hair, skin subtleties were missing as well as detail in background objects). A huge plus were all the scenes, creatively conceived, I've never seen before in an animated film in this genre.
My main criticism is the excessive time devoted to Ne Zha's worst behaviors."
74,哪吒之魔童降世,25,zhaoxue-60451,"I dont like cartoons actually, but it is said that this is is soooo good. So i decided to give it a try and it turns out to be an awesome movie. Worth the ticket and highly recommend watching it."
75,白银帝国,1,drumax-759-417828,"First off this movie LOOKS great. The cinematography, the period costumes, the landscapes and the sets were masterfully done in exacting details giving the movie a genuine feel of the period (Late Imperial China during the Boxer Rebellion). It is an historical drama as well as a tragic love story telling of a pivotal time in a family. The gravity of the film never lets up and the drama is, at some points, a bit over the top but the subject matter, the crumbling of a banking family by external and internal problems, is a heavy one. This movie comes with some very harsh scenes and will not be for everyone but those who enjoy well shot, well acted (if not a bit over the top on the drama), and well set period pieces with a touch of history will like the movie. I did."
76,白银帝国,2,azrael_land,"This is the story of the son who is forced to take over family business, and a development of his relation with his father. Each of them represents a different moral. The father is the caretaker, he wishes to continue his family line and fortune and represents conservative values. While the son is more of an individual concerned with his conscience and the suffering of the people around him. He will not sacrifice his family about them, but he is willing to sacrifice his family's fortune. The plot is even more intriguing because the father and the son have known the same woman which one marries while the other loves. On the other hand the movie fails to inform the viewer about the main historic events that direct the events of the movie, but are barely mentioned. Also there are some personages, like the two managers that appear in two many fragments without justifying the shallow development of their personages. Personally I like it's good moral ending, though it might be a little artificial."
77,白银帝国,3,Thepastgazette,Typical Chinese movie: historically false and exaggerated in the sensitivity and depth of the characters. Interesting but distorted historical setting and boring.
78,白银帝国,4,dbborroughs,"Beautiful to look at epic from China that is sort of the cinematic equivalent to a trashy summer read by way of a Russian novel.Told in flashback the film concerns a wealthy banking family many centuries old. There are four brothers. One is a kind deaf mute, One is a cruel master, the third is artistic and hated by the father and the forth is to get the banks...through circumstances best left to the soap opera the hated third son is forced to choose between the life he wants and taking over the family business. Oh yea, I believe his step mom his an ex-girlfriend and its all coming to boil about the time of the boxer rebellion.If you think I completely understood what happened you're mad. There are lots of plot lines, many of which seem to appear and disappear randomly. And with many plot lines comes many characters and somewhere along the way I got really lost.Okay, yes I shouldn't have watched this knowing I was going to be up past 2 AM - but I was curious--and yes I probably should have stopped when I realized I was at sea- but I didn't and I pressed on...My feeling is its a great looking mess of a movie that should have been longer or remained a novel. The ending left me going- thats it? Apparently.Then again I was never much for soap operas on a grand scale so I was probably the wrong audience for this.I'd take a pass unless you really love soap operas or want to see a film that visually is a complete and total work of art.."
79,白银帝国,5,huyzer,"My nephew votes this movie to be an 8 out of 10. For point of reference, he is 14 years old, and is going to be in 9th grade after Summer.So, I asked what he liked about the movie: He liked the storyline and the ending. The main characters were really good actors. It was just a good movie overall. He warns, ""JUST DON'T WATCH THE TRAILER. It made the movie look bad.""Now, me, his uncle, this is what I think: If you're an empathetic person, and can ""live vicariously"" through the characters and understand their situation, you will be moved by many scenes in the movie. I, myself, was forming some tears in a few scenes.It is a family drama, and is realistic. Being Asian, I can empathize with the cultural dynamics.Some fun facts direct from the director. :) (If my notes and hearing are correct):The movie was shot in 4 and 1/2 months. (Wow, that's fast! BUT, the movie is very professionally made, done with love and attention. The scenes are beautiful visually. The locations, wow!)From preproduction work, to shooting, to editing and post, was a total of 6 years. (That's a LOT of work.)It was filmed in China in 13 cities, 13 provinces, and on 46 sets.The film has been to 14 festivals, and has won 19 awards.200 tons of red earth had to be carried manually by people, up the hill/mountainside to disguise an asphalt road for a scene.********* SPOILER: Don't quote me on this, but the street scene where one lady (wife?) was kidnapped, had 600(? maybe it wasn't the scene, but total in costume department? Sorry, I can't remember.) costumes in it! Talk about a major wardrobe/costuming department. SPOILER end **********Christina Yao, the director, is such a nice lady. :D Thank you for sharing your time, stories, and answering all our questions. It was a terrific, interesting, and informative experience for my nephew and me. Your 3 hours with our small group of 12 was over and above expectations. Thank you! Take care, Huy"
80,大明劫,1,Quannianjiexia,"As the Ming Studies said, ""ChuanTing died lead the fall of the Ming Dynasty.""
It's true. The extinction is not an accident but a historical necessity. The collapse of the Ming Dynasty was caused by factors such as famine, plague, eunuch, roving bandits, Later Jin dynasty... These are not a temporary disaster but also a long-standing disadvantage. Sun chuanting is undoubtedly the last hope of the Ming Dynasty when the dynasty is falling. It's just like what Li Youke said in the film, ""severe cases can't be treated with a strong medicine."" This is the sorrow of the Ming Dynasty with over 300 years, and also the sadness of Chinese history."
81,绣春刀,1,TheCalcium,"I watch a lot of Wuxia movies and Japanese war/Sengoku/Restoration ones. This includes shorts, fully fledged full motions, and animation.While many fail to provide a relevant plot line, or have a messy script, ""Brotherhood of Blades"" manages to satisfy the *unprofessional* eye.Fighting sequences Unlike during the classic ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", here you get fights and jumps which seem reasonable. For those of you who are interested in the Asian martial arts, you will see that they have focused on hits and slashes used in some of them. The mass fights are somewhat ""wait for one to fall, attack after that"" for the enemy, but still satisfying. Music This is the only area in which the movie ended-up being like a dud bomb. My personal opinion is that the ""epic"" musical pieces which accompanied my watching the movie were misplaced. Most of the times they were too epic for the scene they represented. However, when there was real need for an epic piece, it failed to deliver.Romance As we have three main male characters, we also have three main romantic endeavours. These micro-stories focus on two entirely different women and a career. (Yes, I just called the career something of a romantic companion). Both love stories seemed classic for the age in which the movie is set, and the overall attitude of the female characters was pleasurable to watch.Overall Plot Lines In reality, the movie pays little to no attention to the very Manchurian vs Han war, although it is key in a specific scene. The whole story is mainly focused on the three assassins, as hinted to by the title. Instead, we focus on a certain piece of the shared story of three imperial assassins. They encounter corruption, theft, treason, conspiracy, death of a close one, and more. Now, about the Western feel - I do believe this movie is not a typical Wuxia representative, as it does use a lot of exceptionally pretty effects to enforce the colours, some battle scenes and blood splatter. However, it does not by any means seem to me to be too un-Chinese (if there is such a thing). Disclaimer: This is my first full IMDb review. Bear with me and my non-professional take on things :)"
82,绣春刀,2,quincytheodore,"With the betrayal and corruption theme, Brotherhood of the Blades resembles a gangster movie set in modern era, though the choice on making it with martial art effect was a sound one. It delivers the story with different perspectives of the main characters equally, as well as admirable action sequences. Nonetheless, it is bogged down by a couple of unrealistic characterizations. There are several subplots which are simply hard to relate to, especially when these characters act in such excessively theatrical manner.Story revolves around three brothers who work as elite officers, occasionally moonlighting as assassins. Despite the dangerous line of work, they are still troubled by various issues, mostly pertaining money. When a chance to gain riches comes, with life-threatening conspiracy behind it, they must decide how to deal with the precarious situation. The film is at its best when it depicts the three leads continuously.Each of them has their own problem, their actions have further consequences that affect the others. This results in a mild wit battle against the villain, though it's not fully realized. Acting for the leading role is good, these brothers are sympathetic and easy to cheer for, mainly since everyone else is completely corrupt. Unfortunately, this shared spotlight doesn't always work. At some points the subplots are reaching too far and the acting performance suffer from it.Supporting characters like the courtesan occasionally acts in blank stare or unidentifiable emotion. Others seem like they are shoehorned to bolster the cast or vilified just for the sake of creating unlikeable personas. Not only that, these on-screen characters also make awful decisions. For a movie with a lot tension and drama, these moments feel forced and exhausting to watch.Choreography is still great, a boon for martial art movie. The action moves fluidly and precisely. I personally like how the film is very confident on how it uses terrains or weapons for the spectacle. Brotherhood of Blades could've been better if it had used more restraint on a couple of its subplots, nevertheless the mix of crime drama and stylish martial art will entertain the fans of this genre."
83,绣春刀,3,lyx-1,"This is one of the best Chinese period movie by far. The tale has enough plot twists to hold the audience's interest, the action is not too CGI wirefu, the persistent theme of brotherhood in Woo's movie is well-executed, the acting is low key and believable. Can't understand the low ratings, except perhaps there's disappointment in anticipating more choreographed action.The tale of corruption, ruthlessness and court intrigues sets the backdrop for the historic fall of the Ming Dynasty to the Manchurian Qing Dynasty. The chaos, killings, double betrayals, etc. characterize the perils of a realm in decay, and the ascend of an external threat. The movie is stronger for not shying away from the portrayal and in offering an uncomfortable end.For once, the plot, characters and the historic backdrop actually held my interest more than the swordplay. For this I awarded a higher rating to mitigate the down votes from those expecting a wuxia blood splattered wirefu action and were disappointed to see mediocre bladework."
84,绣春刀,4,kosmasp,"The international title is very fitting, though I can't tell you what the original title means. If you like Eastern movies, and especially the ones with swords involved in the action, you will like this too. The action is amazing and you can tell it's never easy to shoot and make those fights as believable as we see them here.The story is pretty decent and easy to follow (maybe to easy for some, but you can't always have complex stories). It's about Honor, love and betrayal, so some might call it overly dramatic in its structure, but you have to have some pillars to build your story around. And then have the fighting mean something: Great stunts and good enough acting overall"
85,绣春刀,5,Foutainoflife,"This movie has some awesome action scenes. It is centered around Imperial Assassins being caught in the crosshairs of corruption. It is literally a tale where you can't win for losing. There's some drama to it that was sorta ""blah"" but the action scenes make up for it. I enjoyed it."
86,绣春刀,6,kluseba,"Brotherhood of Blades is a very entertaining wu xia movie. It combines dynamic martial arts and sword fights with historical costumes and settings and a dramatic dose of suspense in form of complex conspiracies. The greatest thing about the movie is that its outcome is quite unpredictable. Until the final fifteen minutes, it's not exactly clear who is friend and who is foe. This is a welcome change to Hollywood films featuring a lone wolf protagonist who fights his corrupted superiors. Until the final scene, it remains a mystery who is going to survive or not. Once again, this is a great change from Hollywood movies featuring a protagonist who is going to survive against all odds. This film will keep you on the edge of your seat until its dramatic resolution.The story revolves around three Imperial Assassins who are charged to eliminate powerful eunuch Wei who has become a nuisance for the young Ming dynasty emperor. However, the leader of the trio decides to spare the eunuch and accepts a bribe instead without telling his colleagues. Back in the capital, the three sworn brothers are both tracked down by the eunuch's numerous followers who want them to take their secret to the grave and by suspicious government officials who realizes something is afoul. As if that weren't enough, they have to face numerous personal challenges. The youngest of the trio has fallen in love with the local pharmacist's daughter, the second assassin wants to buy the freedom of a prostitute who despises him for having participated in killing her family and the oldest assassin is tricked into getting promoted to be under constant surveillance. The trio decides it must flee the capital city in order to save their lives but their enemies give everything to try to prevent their escape.Aside the fascinating story, the movie convinces with a gloomy and tense atmosphere that brings the dying Ming dynasty back to life. The emotional acting performances are very solid and show three overall sympathetic protagonists with strong moral compasses but quite a few personal weaknesses as well which makes them dynamic and round characters. The fight choreographies are intense and not as exaggerated as one is used to from numerous other wu xia movies. This approach suits the film's more authentic tone.Brotherhood of Blades might not reinvent the genre but is one of the very best movies of its kind in recent memory. Especially the plot is truly intriguing while the film's atmosphere, settings, acting and choreographies are other positive elements. The movie became such an unexpected success that it spun off a prequel released three years later. If you like Asian cinema, you can't go wrong with Brotherhood of Blades."
87,绣春刀,7,kelly-gaudreau,I am beginning to find myself as a fan of wuxia films. They are proving to be entertaining and the storylines do keep you involved. Thoroughly enjoyed the Brotherhood.
88,绣春刀,8,skullfire-48012,"Well acted, scripted and directed, there's nothing to not like about this film."
89,绣春刀,9,Leofwine_draca,"BROTHERHOOD OF BLADES is a film blessed with an interesting, conspiracy-focused historical storyline and some watchable action sequences, but it also suffers from the problems associated with mainland Chinese cinema. Thus, we get a relatively simple storyline that's bagged down in endless padding with lots of unnecessary dialogue, character and complexity that adds nothing at all apart from to slow down the proceedings. In addition, the casting is particularly bland, with lots of earnest but interchangeable faces adding nothing to the fun. I had the pleasure of watching this on Blu-ray and it looks beautiful in high definition, with costumes, staging and action handled well, so it's just a pity that it didn't have a bit more substance to it."
90,西游记之大闹天宫,1,xxXStarWarriorXxx,"Okay, it's not exactly 'Lord of the Rings' but it's not as bad as the reviewers here say it is. People complaining about lack of depth and change in characters, most of them are deities so what do you expect. I thought the visuals, costumes, make-up etc were also excellent. It may appear as a kid's movie for some but thats a good thing, it can be enjoyed by all ages. I couldn't believe the guy that played Monkey King is the same guy who played IP MAN, wasn't an easy job but he pulled it off and other actors were also great. I'm actually looking forward to the sequel if it is in the making I would recommend it to anyone, don't believe the reviews they're just talking rubbish."
91,西游记之大闹天宫,2,sugarmack,"I just saw this film with my mother, a 65-year old Chinese woman (who has trained under some masters of kung fu), who grew up reading the stories of the Monkey King (whereas I'm more familiar with the Japanese Series, 'Monkey Magic'). My mother was delighted at how faithful this film was, with so many of the characters and substories being very close to how she remembers them.Unlike other reviewers, we found the CGI to be quite good (a couple of bad spots, but in other places, stunning!) We thought the acting and direction was also really good. Donnie Yen is such a wonderful and naughty monkey. His movement is fantastic, whether he was fighting or being a lazy monkey. Chow Yun Fat a benevolent Jade Emperor, and Aaron Kwok a coolly evil demon king.The film is also incredibly fun. This isn't going to win any Oscars, but if you're out to have fun, it's a better adaptation of the beginning of Journey to the West than most."
92,西游记之大闹天宫,3,thesimpsonatsixam,"Before starting my review, I would like to state that I grew up on old Hong Kong series. I have experienced many versions of Journey to the West, including the 1986 version(the one I enjoyed most).I have seen many bad reviews on this movie due to it's over-the-top cgi, bad translations, and poor plot. With the exception of bad translation, I have to disagree with the other two points.The CGI is a bit over exaggerated, but the viewer has to accept the movie's setting before they can actually enjoy the ride. It is not your every day thriller, but more of a mythology. Although there are a few scenes with 1-2 seconds flash of unpolished CGI, the CGI overall is not bad at all. Tying back to my experiences with Hong Kong series, most of them had aerial flights, small styrofoam explosions, and clunky lasers, but it did not deter me from how the series were overall great. As a recap, don't look at the CGI as a turn off, but enjoy it as an enhancement to your epic ride.The plot was a well condensed version of Journey to the West series. These series were often countless episodes, which is fine because they cater to a certain type of audience. However, The Monkey King(2014) is adapted and made for younger and foreign audiences. The film gives you the typical plot with the struggle of good and evil and eventually the good winning the fight.Yes, like other epics, the movie shows the up-and-coming of the hero(sun wu kong) that eventually triumphs evil, but the film has many underlying Chinese philosophies that can be realized with a little bit knowledge about Bhuddism, the dominant religion in Asia (where the movie was made). The end fight when Sun Wu Kong was hit on the head with his own weapon was literally a slap on the head for him to look back at his actions. That split of a second, which could be an indefinite amount of time for a deity, Chang'e taught him (with very bad translations) the costs of immortality.Enough of the philosophy talk and lets move on into the fun winks to the audience that have had the opportunity to watch the Journey to the West series. From the 72 tricks and 3 knocks on the head Sun Wu Kong received from his master to the released of the horses in heaven, there are many scenes where the movie stay true to the original series. Off course the film had to have it's own taste on the story, but it never deviates too far from the original. Events may be out of placed, but they were in the movies at specific time slots that would make sense to the new twist on a classic story.My tip before watching the movie is to just be open minded about the culture and have a fun time."
93,西游记之大闹天宫,4,caseymoviemania,"When THE MONKEY KING debuted the teaser trailer sometimes last year, I was doubtful whether Donnie Yen was really up for the legendary Sun Wukong role or not. Even the glimpse of the special effects doesn't look engaging enough to convince me whatsoever. However, upon finally watching it, this nearly four-years-in-the-making production proves to be a well-worthy cinematic experience after all.WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?During an ongoing war between god and demon on the Heavenly Palace, Bull Demon King (Aaron Kwok) lost the battle against Jade Emperor (Chow Yun-Fat). However, Jade Emperor's daughter, Princess Iron Fan (Joe Fan), begs her father for mercy because she loves Bull Demon King very much. Jade Emperor ends up banishing both of them to the Fire Mountain and forbids them to enter Heavenly Palace ever again. Meanwhile, a monkey spirit is born out from Princess Nuwa's (Zhang Zilin) magic stones which later grows up as a mischievous adult. Soon he is trained under Master Puti (Tian Hai Yi) and names him as Sun Wukong. After Wukong completed his master's training, he returns to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruits where he originally belongs to reunite with his fellow monkey clan and calls himself as Handsome Monkey King. Trouble arrives when Bull Demon King sees Wukong as his golden opportunity to use him as bait to access Heavenly Palace, while waiting for the right moment to wage war against the god all over again.THE GOOD STUFFLast seen in 2012's MOTORWAY, Soi Cheang's direction is colorful and yet entertaining enough to please most of the die-hard fans of the Sun Wukong story. Speaking of story, Szeto Kam Yuen's and Edmond Wong's screenplay is a fairly satisfying combination of action, comedy, romance and fantastical elements all rolled into slick package. Christopher Young's music score, in the meantime, is simply majestic. The action sequence, which is choreographed by Donnie Yen himself, is often exhilarating and epic in scope.As Sun Wukong, Donnie Yen has successfully delivers one of his best performances ever seen since IP MAN (2008) and IP MAN 2 (2010). And likewise, he proves to be such a nimble fighter as usual, especially when he uses his golden staff. Other actors, such as Peter Ho as the scheming Erlangshen and Chow Yun-Fat as the noble Jade Emperor, are equally acceptable as well.MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT(S)The ""all-hell-breaks-loose"" duels during the movie's spectacular finale.THE BAD STUFFDespite the hefty amount spent on the budget, the special effects are average at best. Even there are times the special effects looks like a rushed job. Some of the other cast, including Aaron Kwok's villainous turn as Bull Demon King, Kelly Chen as Guanyin and Gigi Leung as Chang'E, are sadly underwritten.FINAL WORDSWhile THE MONKEY KING is far from the best movie adaptation ever seen from Wu Cheng'en's classical novel of Journey to the West, it remains a satisfying effort worth checking out for this Chinese New Year.caseymoviemania.blogspot.com"
94,西游记之大闹天宫,5,dubbska,"When reviewing The Monkey King, most reviewers forget the purpose of the movie: G RATED entertainment meant for ALL AGES. Teeners will abuse the CGi lame bits, film enthusiasts will lament to the point of misguided critique as to the lack of depth building and plot complexities as portrayed by the original books and film purists will pick every personal gripe until the bones appear.... However at the end of the day as a family movie for all ages old and young it is a definite winner.As a absolute devoted fan since the 70's of the NipponTV incarnation of this tale, it was absolutely fun to watch with my kids and parents as the Director intended, to introduce and showcase a very popular traditional Chinese story to a larger demographic western audience with a modern feel and fun easy to digest storyline. (Thus the use of some headline artists in the main roles)The obvious details of the screenplay to book adaption aside, Donny Yen really brings SUN WUKONG to animated life much as he re-birthed IP MAN for modern audiences.A truly memorable performance by Chow Yun Fat and supporting casts makes it a benchmark movie amongst the last few recent ""MONKEY"" re-envisaged movies of recent years.Maybe not a movie for the full on Chinese mythology traditionalist but certainly one NOT TO MISS for the dedicated devotee of the MONKEY story sub genre."
95,西游记之大闹天宫,6,shawneofthedead,"On paper, everything about The Monkey King screams blockbuster. It's an adaptation of Journey To The West, the classic Chinese novel which tells the hugely-beloved tale of a daring, gifted monkey who falls from the heavens and must find his way back again. It stars three of Chinese cinema's most familiar and respected faces: Donnie Yen, Chow Yun-Fat and Aaron Kwok. Hollywood talents have been recruited to oversee the make-up and special effects for the film. In theory, this is a film to get enormously excited about.In practice, everything about The Monkey King screams travesty. The movie is remarkably faithful to some elements of the novel, and deviates tragically in others. All three stars are hamstrung in their roles, forced to play the fool or brood anti-heroically in place of a script that actually gives them something real and meaty to do. The CGI is mostly awful, and the make-up/costumes almost laughably amateurish. Brew all those mistakes together, and director Cheang Pou-Soi has really mucked it up big-time.The film opens with an epic war in the heavens, one that results in the goddess Nüwa having to sacrifice herself to rebuild the celestial palace of the Jade Emperor (Chow). Monkey (Yen) is one of the vestiges of Nüwa's grace, cast down to the mortal realm and trapped in a mountain. Monkey's fate, so it seems, can bring peace or chaos; his own mischievous personality balanced between good and evil. As he trains with a pack of human disciples who mock him for being more simian than they are, Monkey picks up skills, weapons, and a monumental ego. Soon, he establishes himself as the King of Huaguo Mountain, where he lives with his obedient flock of monkeys. But, under the manipulative influence of the Bull Demon King (Kwok), Monkey soon finds himself returning to the heavenly palace to wreak havoc beyond anyone's worst nightmares.Journey To The West is, truly, a marvellous source of material for a film adaptation: it's morally rich, thematically complex and spiritually enlightening, with huge helpings of adventure, fantasy and derring-do. The allegory, of course, is one that chimes with the Buddhist scriptures: the hubris of Monkey doubles as that of humankind, the notion that we believe ourselves to be somehow greater and more important than we are, that we can rail against the heavens and win. Monkey's journey is one of humility and, eventually, enlightenment.Almost miraculously, The Monkey King - which focuses on Monkey's fall from grace, a mix of his own arrogance and the demonic lies he unfortunately chooses to believe - wastes almost every iota of the novel's magic and potential. The script is dreadful, blundering from scene to scene with little care for continuity or character development. It dutifully checks off each stage of Monkey's rebellion against the Jade Emperor - from anointing himself the Great Sage Equal To Heaven to, briefly, becoming the divine horsekeeper and later eating forbidden celestial peaches - but fails to connect any of them in a meaningful way. In fact, it shambles about so much that it becomes unintentionally funny.You might think that the three actors holding up the film might salvage it in some way. They do, and they don't, largely because the terrible script prevents them from doing much good. Yen manages to be charismatically cheeky as Monkey, even though he seems to think that acting like a monkey involves blinking a lot and very fast. He gets approximately one scene to tumble through the air with his trademark acrobatic grace, after which he's submerged beneath a maelstrom of CGI and wirework. Kwok has been set to dark, brooding mode, which he does quite well, but he never really bothers to snap out of it. Chow, with his blue contact lenses, is the only one who seems to be in on the joke, twinkling his way through scenes that require him to throw off extraneous lines of dialogue or float unconscious in mid-air.It's hard to shake the feeling, too, that most of the film's budget went to securing the services of Yen, Kwok and Chow. The other actors seem to have wandered in from a grade-school production of Journey To The West, dressed in costumes they might as well have made themselves. Peter Ho, in particular, is hilariously bad as Er Lang Shen, the devious celestial deity who has it in for Monkey. Through much of his unfortunately considerable screen-time, Ho looks permanently constipated. Cameos from the likes of pop singers Kelly Chen and Gigi Leung - the former plays Guan Yin, Goddess Of Mercy, and the latter the immortal moon-dwelling Chang'E - add to the generally trippy effect of the film.The special effects are, on the whole, terrible: a lot of the time, the film feels like a creaky albeit well-intentioned television adaptation from the 1970s, which is unfortunate given the forty intervening years of technological development. Everything is green-screened within an inch of its life, and almost all of it feels awfully fake. Some moments are nicely-rendered, but those are soon forgotten beneath the deluge of psychedelic Buddhas and sparkly goddesses. Leave us not forget the costumes, which look as if they were picked up from a store dumping its unwanted Halloween stock.If you can suffer through the first two-thirds of the film, The Monkey King actually seems to find its feet in its final half-hour. The action beats have a genuine snap of tension and the drama is rounded out by a welcome touch of comedy. It's still a surreal and not altogether well- put-together mess, but it's a great deal more effective in a narrative sense. Too bad it comes about an hour after the audience has run out of doubt from which the film can benefit."
96,西游记之大闹天宫,7,kctiong,"Do not watch this at the cinema as it not worth your time or money. Don't even bother renting it as you are better off not seeing this version of ""The Monkey King"". Why you may ask.. well I'll list it in point form below (spoilers free.. no worries). 1. Poor writing, dialogues and story line. 2. Not faithful to the source material. 3. Worst CGI ever to grace the silver screen. Literally... Even a sub par video game CG is much better than this and this movie consist of 70% CG which is really really unbearable to watch and to sit through. Lots and lots of lazy CG work where they copy and paste the same model over and over again. 4. Fight sequence are horribly choreographed. Even Donnie Yen's star power can't save it. 5. No character development in the story whatsoever. You don't even bother or care about any of the characters on screen. 6. The costumes for the animals humonoid are simply horrible. Even sesame street is better than this."

98,西游记之大闹天宫,9,YJLcool,"The Monkey King (西游记之大闹天宫, literal translation: Journey to the West:  Havoc in Heaven) is a disappointing and terrible fantasy action epic  adaptation of the classic Chinese literature Journey to the West (西游  记). This film was said to be 4 years in the making and the end result  is a terrible mess.  The script is weak and severely lack of content and depth. Character  development is heavily absent in this film and the film expects the  audience to know most of the characters that appeared on screen  immediately without brief explanation of who they are. Although the  film is filled with credible actors, but they're mostly are forgettable  cameo roles that doesn't make much impression at all throughout the  film. They just come and go for the sake of the story.  Although Donnie Yen provides a decent performance as the monkey Sun  Wukong (孙悟空), but it's ultimately hampered by the overall production of  the film. The romance between WuKong and the fox spirit is unconvincing  and awkward, the challenge between Buddha and WuKong were absent in  this adaptation, the portrayal of God Erlang (二郎神) is extremely  inaccurate to the point it's insulting to the people who worship or  respect him.  Worst, the story is heavily altered from the original that it makes the  expected outcome by the end of the film doesn't make sense at all. The  climactic battles in heaven (the so-called havoc) is not as epic as the  trailer might have promised, the action fight sequences were chaotic  and difficult to watch in most cases, most of the deities of heaven are  not present in the climatic battle and The four heavenly kings were  swiftly defeated as if they're nothing.  While the costumes and makeup were acceptable, the CGI effects for the  entire film is extremely terrible and incomplete, as if the entire  production was heavily rushed for Chinese New Year release. It also  proves that you can't make the entire film with only green screen in  the background, you have to put some effort to build miniatures or real  sets or even find real, nice location for shooting the required scenes  for the film.  This film is not reinventing the classic story that's been told many  times before, but destroys it. This is a bad, bad film. It's a pain to  waste money and time to watch it and I will certainly not watch it  again.  Rating: 3.5/10"
99,西游记之大闹天宫,10,briantumor1023,"Being an American imbued in this ego-mongering, greed-centric culture and it's pitifully vacuous religious folklore and totally unfamiliar with the story behind the 'Monkey King', I was hesitant to watch this since I had to read subtitles which turned out to be difficult at best due to translation issues, but I did manage to get the gist of the story as it unfolded, and I couldn't help becoming involved in the characters soon after it began. The special effects were not the cutting edge I've grown to expect from Hollywood, but considering the complex fantasy nature of the story, I'm glad that they didn't waste time and money trying to go that route since this story is obviously full of ancient iconic elements that have such a nebulous foundation with each other and history that the relationships between them and the time-line of events would not have flowed as well if they had. I thoroughly enjoyed the spirit of innocence and interminable joy demonstrated by the Monkey King at each stage of his travels. The spirit of his appreciation for life was contagious, and I found myself feeling better about my own reality as a result."

Donnie Yen, Aaron Kwok, Chow Yun Fatt, Joe Chen, Peter Ho, Kelly Chen, Gigi Leung, and many more.Highest Budget for an Asian Movie, an estimated, RMB500 million (US$88 million). Invited Avatar, Pirates of Caribbean, Spider-man 3 special effects team to help out with the IMAX and CGI effects.What is the results? A new height attained in the Chinese Film Industry. Journey to the West is one of the 4 most famous Chinese Novel in the world, and to tackle a classic tale is always a huge risk(see The Sorcerer and the White Snake, a huge critical and box office disappointment).Many thought that this might be another failure, but the results is actually very surprising.Donnie Yen's Monkey King ""Sun Wu Kong"" is so good and Donnie is so into-character that most viewers do not know its him until the end credits. Despite the heavy make-up, his emotions were able to touch the hearts of audience, as we can clearly see this monkey display curiosity, sadness, aggression like never before. This may just be the best Sun Wu Kong we have ever seen, right up there with the one starring Liu Xiao Ling Tong.Props to Aaron Kwok too, for being such a good villain and making the viewers hate him.The plot has a little bit of twist and changes from the original journey to the west story, but they were not overboard and the story is kept simple perhaps to introduce worldwide audience to this Chinese Folktale.The CGI is a new level compared to previous Chinese movies. Watch out for the last fight scene, the CGI is easily Hollywood standard.A huge milestone is reached on 31st January 2013, on Chinese New Year, we see the rebirth of Sun Wu Kong and Journey to the west.Asians can finally be hopeful, because its no longer Western Superheroes such as Iron Man and Thor dominating, but our very own Eastern Superhero, the Monkey King is here to stay."
101,西游记之大闹天宫,12,bcheng93,"...with a budget of almost 90 million US dollars(biggest Chinese movie budget to date), and this is what they came up with? there were many major problems with this movie, first off having Donnie Yen as the monkey king was a big big no no. the mans facial features are as expressive as wood and recently you can tell how egotistical he has become. he wants every big role in a big movie even if it isn't right for him and in this movie he makes a fool out of himself till 3/4's of the way thru. he is known for his action movies and there isn't much of that as the movie is almost all cgi and wire-fu.for most of the movie the cgi was almost laughable, i've literally seen better in video games, and they had help from the cgi team that did Avatar( i think the team took the money and ranned ). it was going to be hard to cgi the right way cause the book was so detailed and deep.i went into this movie not expecting much and wind up not getting much, there were no development of characters, some of the costumes were laughably bad and the other 2 leads weren't that interesting either. basically just about nothing works in this movie...and now for its saving grace.if you watch this movie make sure you finish it, because the last quarter of the movie is freakin awesome and makes up for sitting thru the first 2/3's to 3/4's of the movie. everything picked up close to the end...it almost seemed like a different team stepped in to finish the movie, in every aspect. the fighting got good( you actually see real fight moves from Donnie). the story and acting got tighter and best of all, the cgi looked as good as any that Hollywood can put out, and it was exciting.so, if the movie isn't that appealing...just make sure you watch the last third or quarter and you'll feel a lot less screwed...the ending of the movie was its saving grace and just might save the movie from disaster. i give this movie a 5.8 out of 10. save the popcorn for the last 30 minutes of the movie."
102,西游记之大闹天宫,13,Ucare,"Although it is true that the big part of the original (huge) book was about the Pilgrimage mentioned in the Synopsis, there are two things you should know: the pilgrimage was more an adventure full of battles, monsters, magic powers, and epic Characters, rather than just a pilgrimage; and this movie concentrates on the first part of the book, before the pilgrimage (actually the Monk does not even appear), on the genesis of the Monkey King. The book was written by a great Taoist monk and it is full of hidden knowledge which not everybody can consciously understand, but it is so well done, so full of adventure and action and funny things, so intriguing and entertaining, that in the centuries it became one of the (if not the) most important books in the popular Chinese culture. There are many layers in it and it was made in such a way that almost anybody can enjoy it. The Monkey King became an extremely popular character, and even Dragonball comes from that book! This film is a bit strange, the special effects are not the best, and some things in the realization will need a bit effort from the western audience, but it is OK, you must understand that as said this is a Chinese story and obviously not made with the western people as main target. But whether you are interested or not in the background of the story, the film is pleasant and entertaining and you can surely enjoy it :) Now I just hope there will be other movies with the rest of the book!"
103,西游记之大闹天宫,14,boysailor,"Well, as much as I'm a big follower and a big enthusiast of Donnie Yen's movies or should I say... fantasy movies, lately I'm not quite satisfied with Mr. Donnie Yen's recent ventures. When I go and try to watch a fantasy movie, I do of course go there and expecting to see a lot of visual candies with the use of such colorful special effects. The movie I should say upon seeing this movie is still quite a bit, well really, it is still very RAW specially with the not so special cg efforts, they are not so special effects, they are just failed efforts on trying to create a visual effect, to tell you the truth you can go to YouTube and you can find home-made, amateur videos with better special effects done by kids. The movie is a Total Disappointment for me, very MEDIOCRE film making. I actually had second thoughts on giving it a two star, I was gonna go for 1. ""Take Care Yourself"""

The strangest thing is, the CGI looks like animation.. The CGI reminds me Dr. Who or Quantum Leap. If this is the pinnacle of Chinese special effects, they have a long way to go.If Mystery Science Theatre 3000 was still on TV, this movie would make its debut... how did that POS make it to the states.

I wasn't aware this movie was based off a novel, but if your interested in the film because you enjoyed the book, this review is not for you. The second this film was over, I made it my mission to create an account solely to write this review. My brother suggested this movie to me as a ""joke"", hoping I would watch it and waste 2 hours of my life. Well the jokes on him because I loved it! I laughed more during this film than most comedies I've ever seen. I've never seen a high budget film produce such horrible English subtitles. However, they made the movie! I truly believe the subtitles were a copy/paste job from an online translation website. There is enough of a storyline, coupled with average action scenes to keep your interest in between laughs, and the ending is absolutely priceless. If you enjoy cult films that are celebrated for reaching new heights of terrible, then this is your film. Only mistake I can find is that it wasn't properly labeled as a comedy ; )."
106,西游记之大闹天宫,17,dcarsonhagy,"""The Monkey King"" is like nothing I had ever seen. The movie is based on the Asian legend of Sun Wukong, born from stone. He studied under a Taoist master and learned 72 transformation spells. He had enormous strength and it was told he could travel 102,000 miles in one jump! The hairs on his body possessed magical properties capable of being transformed into clones of the Monkey King himself. He was a trickster, and had an ongoing war with the deities in the Heavens. The makeup, use of green screens, ""wire-fu,"" and a cast of thousands paints one of the most magical stories ever brought to the screen. Donnie Chen is utterly magical in his portrayal of one of the most enduring and beloved Chinese characters. The art direction and cinematography are exceptional. Now, here is a little ""warning"" for would-be viewers. If you are thinking you will be getting a non-stop over-the-top battle laden blood-soaked movie, you had better think again. The version I watched was PG and I felt directed more toward a young audience than an adult one. Although there is some violence, there is no blood. Also, I was fortunate enough to be able to watch the original version, which is in Mandarin (with English subtitles). I will tell you one thing, you'd better brush up on your Evelyn Woods' speed reading courses, because the subtitles do not stay on the screen for very long! Also, the movie starts a little slow but if you will give it a chance, I think you'll find yourself thoroughly entertained.One of the best movies of 2016 and highly recommended. This would be great entertainment for a children's sleep-over or family viewing."

How about complaining that Hollywood movies in the 20th century, including Harry Potter have PLAGIARIZED and COPIED the Asian Chinese concept of the original Monkey King flying in a cape with this magic staff that was invented first in the 16th century!!!  When you complain and whine about the new Monkey King movie with Chow Yun Fat who did a great job, the other guy, Soe Cheang did a good job with the 2014 movie!!! Please stop writing excessively negative and sad articles to sabotage the new 2014 Monkey King movie.  You bad racist people on IMDb.com are directly and indirectly badmouthing and sabotaging the good reputation of the literary genius, Wu Chengén and the magnificent Journey to the West novel.This IMDb.com website is just jealous of the Monkey King 2014 being a decent movie that deserves an 8/10 or at least a 6.5/10. Why don't you say that the X-men is the 3/10 or worst special effects of all times in the X-men. The western people or other people who evaluated this IMDb rating of 4.7/10 is ridiculous and highly unreasonable at www.imdb.com/title/tt1717715. This ""4.7/10""is your opinion and your opinion is wrong and does not make any sense at all. The Hollywood Terminator movie is a 4.5 out of 10!!.

It it a good live-action remake of the 1965 animated feature of the same name (well worth checking out if you're a fan of art films). Donnie Yen does OK as the lead but western fans of his previous films may be left confused and/or disappointed a long time before the 120 mins of 'Fantasy Action' ends - It really helped that I was already familiar with the story as a lot happens in that time. I wonder how the second part will compare with the excellent Journey To The West: Conquering the Demons (2013) as the story from that follows this one - that's not a spoiler is it?

It also happens to be one of the worst Chinese films I've watched. What we have here is a sprawling CGI mess of endless stupid action sequences full of lamentable CGI effects and terrible choreography. Donnie Yen frankly embarrasses himself in the lead role, going way over the top with the physical tics and comedy, while others like Chow Yun-Fat and Aaron Kwok are merely wasted. The CGI is so bad that I've seen early-morning children's CGI animation with better effects, and the story is non-existent. Warning: it rarely gets any worse than this!"

If you're into early CGI campy martial arts movies, this is definitely for you. The actor for Wu Kong is a professional martial artist and the fights are well-choreographed. I did get annoyed at how often Wu Kong blinks, which is symbolic of his innocent and hyper personality, and thankfully is an element that was vastly decreased in later renditions. His character is still likeable despite his hijinks. The monkeys are a bit nightmare-fuelish, but what do you expect from people in hair suits? We're here for a good time, not the realism. The following two films REALLY stepped up their game with the special effects! There is a bit of continuity break with the fate of the monkey clan and a change in actors, but these two things aside, I have not much more qualms with the films.

115,大话西游3,1,paul_haakonsen,"Sometimes it is unwise to keep adding additional movies to an already established movie franchise, and ""A Chinese Odyssey: Part Three"" was one of those incidents. Where as the previous movies were quite entertaining and interesting, this third movie completely failed to deliver where it mattered.The storyline in ""A Chinese Odyssey: Part Three"" was, and I am being bluntly honest here, a scrambled and confusing mess of whatever writer Jeffrey Lau was attempting to do with the storyline. It was non-coherent and just didn't make much of any kind of sense. It was this jumble of a storyline that ultimately brought the movie down beneath mediocrity, and it never recovered from this massive blow.I initially sat down to watch ""A Chinese Odyssey: Part Three"" because of the previous movies, but also because Karen Mok starred in it. But not even she lifted up the movie as she was also struggling hard with the lack of coherent script and almost non-existing storyline.The action in the movie was adequate and nicely enough choreographed, but it was hardly enough to sustain a whole movie with action sequences alone.It should be said that the costumes and sets were quite nice, and were as to be expected of a movie of this particular genre. So that was at least working in favor of the movie.""A Chinese Odyssey: Part Three"" is the black sheep of the family; the movie that never should have been made.As much as I enjoy the Asian cinema, then ""A Chinese Odyssey: Part Three"" was a bitter pill to swallow, and it offered next to nothing in terms of entertainment value, especially in comparison to its predecessors."
116,大话西游3,2,clubhonda,"3 out of 10 on IMDb sounds about right for this incoherent film which a)neither makes sense b)nor is it funny. Wu Jing might be a talented action star, but he sucks as the monk compared to the original, and the story line just doesn't make sense. The Goddess of Mercy and the Jade Emperor are also terrible. For such a star studded cast, how can the movie be this bad?? Was the entire film crewed abducted by triads and forced to shoot this? Did a first year film student shoot this and used Jeffrey Lau's name instead? Either way, its a terrible, terrible film and should be avoided. I want 1.5hr of my life back!"
117,大话西游3,3,M1racl3sHapp3n,"There is a particular genre which a lot of people are not aware of and it's called Chinese Fantasy. This is an outstanding example of Chinese fantasy and there is a lot of humor in it. The story is related to the spread of Buddhism in China. It's actually a comedy so do not expect a masterpiece because it's not but if you want to be entertained and have fun with typical Chinese sense of humor then this movie is for you. The characters are excellent and believable actors and the story is a revised version of the traditional Monkey King story. I liked it very much, good CGI and impeccable acting! I had a good laugh."
118,大话西游3,4,kvang145,"Movie has a very good intro and concept that seems to link to the previous Chinese Odyssey. Since the movie is a decade apart in making from the prequel, everything visually, from actors to sets, will be different. A few minutes after the opening and you'll noticed that not only did the visual concepts changed, the mental state of the characters are altered. The movie kept the close to the history, but since the relationships that defines each person is severed, this movie has created not a sequel, but a separate one. Suggests not to watch in sequence to the past two odysseys.Now time for some personal opinions:
If you enjoy the previous, Chinese Odysseys, as much as a 10/10 rating, you'll be extremely disappointed in this one. The CGI hurts the eyes, the combat/action has now taken to ""modern fantasy"" of waving through air for magics, and the love triangle has disappeared. If you're used to modern Chinese fantasy movies, you'll do fine in seeing a new movie, as opposed to a sequel. However, you'll definitely noticed everything that's CGI, because this is one of those movies that don't use visual buffering."
119,大话西游3,5,yeohchitmun,"Spoiled the original Episode 1 & 2.
They tried to copy the original version, unfortunately this is serous failure."
120,大话西游3,6,Movie-Misfit,"By the time we get through all the production companies logos, you feel you have already watched a feature film. The very belated closure to Jeff Lau's Chinese Odyssey trilogy instantly proves to be a far cry from its predecessors - lacking all of what made the first 2 films incredible!Swamped with poor CGI and far too much green-screen-acting, this chapter sees the return of Karen Mok as Jing Jing, and all other characters replaced - and unfortunately, not for the better. Only 20 minutes in, with director Jeff Lau failing hopelessly to recreate that wonderful opening scene from part 1, we see the Longevity Monk (now played by Wu Jing) arrive on screen dressed as Michael Jackson (waaaaay out of date on that one!) as our new Monkey King (played blandly by Han Geng) challenges the Goddess...By the stage, the opening action scene (totally ruined by terrible CGI) fails to impress, and I'm already feeling a stroke coming on as I have still another 70 minutes to get through!!Gone is the beautiful art direction and sets, with smoke filled scenery, wonderfully lit and full of colour...Instead, we get CGI sets - most of which are poorly executed, with half decent ones here and there only to be marred by some crappy digital item or creature, and clean studio sound that completely removes you from the scene. At times, it feels like watching a TV movie rather than a big budgeted film from a prolific director.Han Geng as Joker/Monkey King is absolutely no replacement for the amazing Chow Sing Chi. In fact, its an insult to think that the producers and director thought he could bring the same quality and comic timing to the role! The same can be said for Wu Jing. I love him in the many action roles he has done over the years, but his comedic side and trying to pull off a Law Kar Ying does not work well here at all..!The film gets gradually worse, and if you are lucky to have made it any further than the first 20 minutes, should agree that the whole thing is a complete disaster that should not have been made - or at the very least, went into production 20 years ago with the original cast in place before director Lau got obsessed with bad CGI.Dreadful!Overall: Will break your soul to see such a disappointment, and definitely not worth your hard earned cash..."
121,道士下山,1,A_Different_Drummer,"... TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE.I watch a lot of movies ... so many that the IMDb once tagged me and released me into the wild to see what theatre I would pick.After reading the other member reviews (thanks guys) I think the reason I enjoyed it so much is that I never read the novel nor did I bring any preconceptions.What I found was a beautifully filmed, acted, and directed movie which was just daffy and unpredictable enough to hold my attention.You say PO-TAE-TOE. I say PA-TAT-O.What others see as a mishmash and fighting among writers and directors I see as a puzzle that the viewer needs to put together.Recommended."
122,道士下山,2,george-swg,"I couldn't disagree more with the first two reviews. I give it 7/10. I mean I liked it and I watched it 3 times, there is no shame in that and I'm truthful with myself. There is a lot of wisdom in the movie. Of course it's a Chinese movie and there is a lot of beautiful choreography, but if you listen carefully and you practice martial art, you may like it. The movie is about Kung fu, it's an art but it's also about life about philosophy. Of course, I don't agree with all that said in the movie, but most of the time I agree. But again, it'a Chinese movie, if you don't like IPman, Jet li, Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee don't watch it. Nevertheless, if you don't like them but you like philosophy and wisdom, you may love it anyway."
123,道士下山,3,moritzmeyerautor,"Director Kaige Chen is one of China's most acclaimed directors, so I went in this with relatively high expectations. Unfortunately, this movie turned out as a letdown, being an uneven mess of a movie. It feels like it has had not one, but several directors on set, fighting about what kind of movie they want to do. The final result is disappointing piece of work, which at least has some scenes of magical beauty to save it from being a complete failure.Mixing martial-arts and slapstick comedy is by no means a bad idea, as both genres require a lot of physical talent and choreography. And it has been done several times very successfully, see Kung-Fu Hustle as a prime example. Jackie Chan actually built an entire career on these kinds of movie. In this case however, the formula doesn't seem to work. The plot follows young monk He Anxia, who is forced to leave his temple and find his way in the real world, which is set somewhere in China of the 1920ies. On his journey, He meets several people, from an apothecary who is betrayed by his wife and his brother, to a mysterious janitor, who appears to have mastered a unique art of Kung-Fu, the ""ape style"". Also, somewhere in this is at least one love story, but this is hard to tell. Could be accidental. The whole piece is narrated by He's son, whom we never meet in person throughout the entire movie. Why? That is one of the many, many questions this movie leaves behind. The main character seems to be some kind of Chinese Forrest Gump (there are actually a couple of references to this movie). So, in the first act, He Anxia acts more like a retard, who is overwhelmed by the modern world he sets foot in for the first time. Unfortunately, as the movie progresses, the development of his character is completely left behind. More and more people enter and leave the scenery, as if this was a bus-station, not a movie. Likewise, new plot lines open up, only to be dropped immediately, and the whole thing becomes more and confusing. The title-giving ""Monk, coming down the mountain"" finds himself sidelined, as the story progresses. One cannot say, what came first, but as the movie falls apart dramatically, it also loses its way tone wise. What started more like a screwball comedy, turns into a mystical martial-arts piece and ends up as a gangster- movie. For absolutely no reason, there even is full CGI-sequence with monkey in the jungle. It has absolutely no coherence whatsoever. On the plus side, there are some beautiful shots and the fight- scenes do have some special moments. There is a glimpse of a potentially good movie here and there. It's a pity, that these glimpses haven't been brought to shine in this case. Kaige Chen is a fantastic director, but this movie feels lazy, unambitious and is not a great example of Chinese movie-making."
124,道士下山,4,funismyname,"This movie is filled with wonderful characters, a compelling journey, and a strong positive message with a point at the end. I was entertained and moved emotionally. Most of the reviews I've added are negative. Why comment unless you're compelled to, right? This should indicate it isn't just a film you'll watch and forget. In a week, I watched this five times. I could watch it five more. It's very much like Pinocchio in the way the hero enters the world knowing nothing and then his mistakes lead to a great adventure. Highly recommended."
125,道士下山,5,Mignon00,"A benevolent monk is sent to the world of saints and sinners.While trying to survive, he meets different people with different motives.

Behind the weird circumstances there's always a good reason why someone's on your way.Anyway, great intro, was really promising. The flow was kinda confusing and sometimes seemed excessive but at the end it made sense. A heart of a saint will find its way to survive in the world of sinners."
126,道士下山,6,shide_85,"4/10 - Minor spoilers are present that should not ruin anything out of the plot line.This is not a movie I would recommend to anyone who likes movies and want a ""proper"" movie to watch for a night.What should be added is: This movie is highly suitable for moviebuffs or those who teach in an area related to cinema. Those areas in the movie that are well made are really well made. Those areas that fail are clear and obvious, marking out their presence and their impact on the movie. The highs are high and the lows are really bloody low. The movie still retains a grain of interest. This is a big budget movie.Pro's Those who scouted for locations earned 1 of those stars. Prop, costumes and wardrobe earned another one. Those who made the special effects earned yet another one. Lastly the classical plot earned a mentioning. Chen Chang & Aaron Kwok (Yin and Yang) as well as Wah Yuen also deserves being mentioned as they made solid performances despite what I'll share next. Also note that the budget wasn't small, that much is clear.Con's The (far, very far) over the top martial arts (wirework a la Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) simply was not good and did a HUGE disservice to the movie. Same with the magical (or energetic if you prefer) additions. It detracted one star - so bad and big was the impact of it (i very rarely detract stars).The dialogue was out of place a lot of the time, but it felt construed (allmost as if someone had rewritten it completely, tampered with it from the beginning to the end).Like in Hollywoods older days, explosions were put in for the sake of explosions, actually making some parts as when Chang & Kwok met more of a showpiece for the studio and what they can do rather than a needed addition to the movie.The time of events (mixing modern warfare with classical martial arts did not work with the over the top effects).Some of the moments did simply not line up and the rationality of the characters were out of place.There were also jumps in time which were not smoothly done.There was really badly done symbolism in it, forcing and as far as i know partly misinforming the viewer. Do not get me wrong, i like when these kinds of movies use symbolism (like recently Mr. Six) and the cinematography can be really effective and complimentary to the story - but it isn't here, due to how it was implemented. *To give one example; when Zhou bring a pillar of water up and knocks out Pengs effort. -Just having the courtyard contain water and some open plated fires (for one reason or another) could have allowed the same fight to take place without wireworks and over the top cgi effects.The clear moviereferences baked in were out of place, if you do not even recognise the Matrix references please do not comment in this thread. - Drawing connotations to modern sci-fi in a classical martial arts film is just wrong. If the point is to say that Matrix lent from martial arts movies I do not think anyone in the world previously missed that.And not to forget, an out of the blue circumcision near the start. Genital mutilation of men (or women) should be done by individuals when they are old enough to rule themselves, or give informed consent and take the action to visit a doctor by themselves (excluding when deformities are present etc).So if you are someone who is interested in movies this is a must see, you will take a lot from it - both good and bad. This would be a perfect movie to use if you teach in a related subject as it has extremely well done areas mixed with extremely badly matched and done areas, but not much within the middle. It is rare in that way (yes there are similar movies but they are usually not this well done in other aspects and it's not as clear how bad impact some elements have).Some moments could easily have been movie magic (to give two examples); The fight at the start (easily could have been something else with the exact same setting) but without the forced effects. The sweeping with the broom."
127,道士下山,7,eyeintrees,"Heck, I read all the reviews and thought I really needed to see this one.Everyone waiting for a typical Kung Fu movie isn't going to get one. If that's what you want, go home.However, if you think Kung Fu + Fairytale + The Matrix sounds good, this is one for you.In almost each review all I read was whiny, whingey, unimaginative dross. Lighten up folks, indulge in that wonderful whimsy called imagination and you might come to truly love and appreciate superlative brilliance for a change, instead of the usual crap that comes of movie theatres.One thing that even the unimaginative will enjoy is the incredible beauty and the stunning cinematography.Totally captivating. Even ape strike, which I think I actually understood!"
128,道士下山,8,adamliang41,"The only thing that deserves a bit of praise are some of the effects and kung fu scenes, but even those are a stretch to say the least.This movie is absolutely awful, and its awfulness increases as the so called ""plot"" progresses. JUST KIDDING, there is no plot, even a child can write such a horrendous story. The relations between characters are almost non existing. The movie does not follow the audience's pace at all, for some times the pace is so off that you feel completely cheated to even pay for this movie. Although advertised as a comedy, the only funny thing was how bad the movie is. Although I cannot give examples, imagine a lower school level story line with sci fi effects made by Michael Bay, add in some really weird elements of homosexuality, adultery, and kungfu and tadaaaaa.Do not watch, as the saying goes ""if people tell you something looks and smells like poop so many times, you seriously don't need to eat it"", so DO NOT WATCH IT."
129,道士下山,9,Leofwine_draca,"While I adore Hong Kong cinema and have enjoyed pretty much every sub-genre of film-making to come from that part of the world in the last half century, mainland China is another story. The only consistently quality genre of films that the mainland seems able to make is the historical epic, full of sprawling battles, horses, and martial arts. Everything else is a letdown and MONK COMES DOWN THE MOUNTAIN follows that trend. The narrative is barely focused and involves a monk who is kicked out of the Shaolin Temple due to his misbehaviour. Said protagonist is played by the guy who was the villain in KUNG FU KILLER, Wang Baoqiang, and he's an entirely unprepossessing chap, lacking the charisma and grace to make a role like this work.The plot just sort of ambles along endlessly, throwing in digressions involving supporting characters (the usual martial arts masters, a doctor, a CGI monkey in one random interlude) and plenty of CGI-enhanced fight scenes. I love martial arts fights and some of it is okay here, but too much of it is wire work assisted with flying and gravity-defying feats which aren't to my taste. The supporting cast is better, but underutilised: Lam Suet as a cop, Jaycee Chan as an underwhelming antagonist. The guy who played the Bruce Lee lookalike goalie in SHAOLIN SOCCER is here too, along with Tiger Hu of MAN OF TAI CHI fame. Best of the bunch is the criminally underrated Yuen Wah, playing another badass late on in his career; don't let the occasional bit of doubling fool you, Wah still has it and is by far the best thing in the entire movie. A shame the rest of the film can't match him."
130,道士下山,10,kosmasp,"Life after Shaolin school-the movie gives us a look at this. From someone who got kicked out and actually might not be qualified to be called a Shaolin. But apart from technicalities, this is about an individual who tries to make a living. One way or the other, but always dishing out respect to others. Doesn't change the fact, that he has some major flaws (what Shaolin would steal really?).But that's why the movie has kind of a unique flavor. It's a bit of a mix of things, that make this weird and not as accessible as other martial arts movies, but it still has a lot going for it. Like the fight scenes, which arguably are not the best ever put on film, but are still entertaining enough, if you are into that kind of thing. Which is a statement that rings true for the entire movie"
131,道士下山,11,yoggwork,"It's neither fish nor fowl. The combination of Conan's aura of death, Brokeback Mountain's friendship and a generation of master's pretense and coercion made this wonderful work possible. What does the first 30 minutes have to do with the rest? Daoist monks go to the monk temple every day to ask for people to be enlightened. You simply have to convert to it."
132,木兰：横空出世,1,paul_haakonsen,"Nah, you might want to skip entirely on this 2020 rendering of the ""Mulan"" tale.I wasn't familiar with the existence of this movie, and I must say that I enjoyed both the animated movie from 1998, and the live action movie also from 2020. So as I stumbled upon this 2020 animated movie, of course I took the time to sit down and watch it.First alarm indicator that should have raised an eyebrow was the title of this animated movie, as it has the words ""Kung Fu"" in it. Not really what you would immediately associate with the ""Mulan"" story. But hey, still sat down to watch it. And yeah, the Kung Fu part definitely made sense here, as there was an abundance of fighting throughout the course of this animated movie.As for the storyline, well it was fairly weak and sort of bland. Sure, it was watchable, but hardly entertaining. Yet, I did manage to sit through the entire ordeal with my son, though none of us were overly impressed or entertained by writer Roger Chen's movie and the delivery of director Leo Liao.This is a CGI animated movie, and it had that late 2010s computer game graphics look to it, for better or worse. I will say that the art was passable, but it wasn't the most of detailed textures in the scenes, especially for the environments and backgrounds. And at times the animation itself is wobbly or questionable.The voice acting in an animated movie is everything, and I have to say that for the majority of the movie then the voice acting done by the actors and actresses in this particular animated movie were doing adequate jobs.Ultimately, then ""Kung Fu Mulan"" was an animated movie that had managed to sneak in under the radar for me, and it is will just as unnoticeably return back into oblivious without having left as lasting impression on me.This movie is not something I would recommend you rush out to get your hands on, because it wasn't really worth the effort. I am rating ""Kung Fu Mulan"" a generous four out of ten stars."
133,木兰：横空出世,2,jimimhendrix-31103,"5/10 it's not that badIt's pretty obvious that the $15 million budget was for money laundering, and for the actual movie only $100,000 was used. Just kidding, maybe they threw out the window $15 million :-)Anyways, I was surprised to actually enjoy it. There were bits and pieces of brilliancy here and there. I would say children under 10 would enjoy it no problem. Yes, voice acting is uneven. Yes, the animation is kinda choppy. Yes to any fault you find.But in the end, once again, I actually enjoyed it. I kept feeling I'm watching an extended cutscene from Bioware's Jade Empire, and if you are patient to the end of the movie and you also know the game I mentioned, you will see why :-)"
134,神探蒲松龄,1,Snootz,"This is an asian high-fantasy movie rather than a martial arts flick. So adrenaline junkies looking to get their fix on this are going to be disappointed.This does have a relatively good premise and story. The characters are well-thought out and enjoyable. Unfortunately the English text translation is so extremely bad it is sometimes difficult to follow the story. Typical confusion between he / she / it, extreme mistranslation (in one spot the English is actually written out on-screen and the translation renders it otherwise).But the romantic sub-plot is quite good, and it has a very Asian ending (avoiding spoilers). It does get to a point at near the end where the on-screen CGI is so over the top it feels more like a Transformers movie than fitting in with the rest of the film. That along with the very bad translating gives this a mere 5-star ""mediocre"" rating from me.Those who rated this 1 star... seriously, you're putting this equal to the worst movies ever made? If you can't write better reviews than that don't bother. I'm not sure it warrants the 8 stars some give it, but given a chance and tolerating the butchered translations, it's a mildly interesting 2 hours.I really liked the mind-altering pixie character. Cute as a button and used well throughout the film, both as plot device and emotional prodding."
135,神探蒲松龄,2,fdc2,"This really is an underrated movie. If it were in English it would likely have a 6 to 7 rating I'm certain. Classic Chan with a variant on some Classic Chinese literature, ""Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio"". It is similar to some of the modern versions of ""Journey to the West""."
136,神探蒲松龄,3,boblipton,"Jackie Chan is a poor scribe who can't sell copies of his books for five cents each. He's also a great and mystical demon hunter armed with the magical Yin-Yang pen, which lets him fight and trap the bad demons and make the good ones serve him. Now he's after mirror demon Elaine Zhong. His newer apprentice, Ethan Juan, won't let him exile her into his book because.... well, that's the story, isn't it.And a pretty well-told story it is, with some fine sequences of on-screen magic. There's lots of movie flying and, for fans of Jackie Chan, a nice humorous fight sequence about two-thirds of the way through. It's not as extreme and hilarious as the sort he ran through in the mid- and late 1990s, but, hey, he's older than I am, and it's nice to watch him being funny without anyone breaking any bones in the out-take reel."

139,神探蒲松龄,6,Movie-Misfit,"First off, The Knight Of Shadows is not your typical Jackie Chan, kung fu stunt filled action film! In fact, this is Jackie Chan enjoying himself, dangling on wires and dodging CGI monsters and demons - even throwing in a bit of singing between comedy routines just for fun...I liked this little flick. While I surely missed the master in action, I knew what to expect upon viewing so wasn't disappointed by the end of it. Think A Chinese Ghost Story meets Monster Hunt and you'll be on the right track!The Knight Of Shadows is a big, colourful, character filled fantasy that plays like a tamer version of Takeshi Miike's Great Yokai War but with a much lighter tone.There is some wire-fu and swordplay action of course, but for the most of it Jackie flies around writing spells with his magic brush and scaring kids.It's great to see Jackie in something so different also. It's a genre you never see him venture into, and makes a change from the usual cop role and modern day setting... It would be nice to see hime return to that although with a lot more kung fu fighting!!The Knight Of Shadows will never go down as a classic, but it does entertain somewhat and passes the time positively."

It is a rip-off of other movies, namely ""The Chinese Ghost Story/Qian nu you hun"", except it's done so badly, it's an insult. It's not even funnily bad, it's just pathetic and boring and nonsensical. Can't believe it's a Jackie Chan movie. I went with my parents who are big fans of his movies and we all left the movie wanting to puke. People left halfway, we should have followed but we thought this is Jackie Chan - bah! So what!

This is a fantasy-ghost-movie for family and not an action movie full of fights or mafia or policestories. So please vote it for what it is, and it is a nice fantasymovie, well acted, funny, with some romance and chinese literature.

150,神探蒲松龄,17,daisukereds,"This movie is a half traditional Chinese stories and half video game (CGI that sometimes looks great and sometimes doesn't). It's sort of traditional with lots of spiritual stuff. The production value is pretty high in some set-pieces, and the art direction in general is great. There are also animated cutscenes that are worth the watch (in a style similar to Yoshitaka Amano's art from Final Fantasy).Sadly, the movie is too silly at times, or too slow and boring in it's development for my taste. It has a very simplistic plot, but I imagine this would have been worth it if done correctly, which is a shame. Some minor parts I really enjoyed (almost everything with the ""demon ladies""). A very poor execution drags it down to the floor.As a Jackie Chan movie it has several action scenes.. that aren't memorable. He isn't as nimble or fun to watch anymore. Overuse of CGI (and I can't stress that enough) and noticeable cables being used in the choreography take you out of it. Also.. farts.All in all, I'll remember the short animated sequence, the lovely tragedy in it, and forget the rest."

Lovely score, charming cast, evocative conceptual art, wonderful costuming & makeup. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie."
156,神探蒲松龄,23,nemanjamikicmikser,I enjoy watching every Jackie movie. This is nice Chinese Fantasy/Family movie.
157,神探蒲松龄,24,kosmasp,"If you are a fan of Jackie Chan you won't need me to tell you if you should watch this or not. His charme is enough to do the job. And it is obvious still how good he is - not just in his stunt work, but also in his comedic timing and acting. Something I remember not fully appreciating as much many years (decades) ago.But he's not alone here and his stunt work is not the main attraction ... well it is not supposed to be. I can see how some may feel it is in the end. A lot of wirework and a lot of CGI involved in this. Oh and quite a few masks can be seen in the outtakes/behind the scenes footage at the end of the movie - which is played during the credits and I can only recommend so much! Really worth seeing! Might also sway you to give this an extra point in your rating (not saying if that was the case with me too ...)"
158,神探蒲松龄,25,bravo11,"Hopefully, Jackie did this for the money, because, for me, a big disappointment. There was a glimmer of his former self in the club fight scene, using chairs to defend himself, but otherwise he just looked old (yes, his character was old, but where were the moves?) 2 years since ""The Foreigner"" and ""Kung Fu Yoga""... Please, Jackie, say it ain't so...Storyline OK, liked Handsie, hated Pixie... some attractive females..."
159,大笑江湖,1,ongyekcheng,"For fans of Star Wars, Kung Fu Hustle (Stephen Chow), Swordsman (Tsui Hark) and other iconic movies of the East and West, this martial arts comedy with a refreshingly original (and hilarious one-liners) script will have you splitting your sides.Fans of Hong Kong's veteran funnyman Eric Tsang, Singapore's multi-talented and versatile actor Mark Lee and Taiwan's Jacky Wu, will love the cameo appearances made by these super comics. Also, did I mention the clever use of CGI to boost the visual impact of 'kung fu' moves during the show? A must-watch for aficionados of the comedy-kung fu genre."
160,大笑江湖,2,codynumba2,"Looking at the previous 1/10 review and very little information about this movie it like more people have written it off before ever giving the screening a chance. If you like Martial Arts, Cheesy Acting and Lewd Comedy then you will absolutely LOVE this movie. While browsing through Amazon Prime last night I stumbled across this gem; and, seeing that the name is very similar to Kung Fu Hustle, I gave it a shot. BEST. DECISION. AT. 4AM. The English subtitles are wrong, the acting is so goofy and the overall feel of the movie is just awkward..... yet, it instills a joyous feeling that will berate you with infectious laughter! If you enjoy any of the farce Martial Arts movies i.e. Shaolin Soccer, God of Cookery, then give one a shot :)"

162,大笑江湖,4,dbborroughs,"A young poor cobbler who loves martial arts picture books (this is set in period) gets mixed up with an on the run princess. Saving her life, she promises to aid him should he ever need. He then goes to find her. And alleged adventures occur.How you feel about the film will very much depend upon how you take to the mugging and childlike behavior of the films star Xiao Shen Yang. If you take to his mugging and stupid behavior (it reminded me of a less manic slightly sad faced Jerry Lewis) then you'll love it. If not this is going to be a LONG 91 minutes. It's the sort of thing where toes going up a person's nose during a fight and held for effect is supposed to make you laugh and two men kissing by accident is the punch line of a joke.I found the film profoundly dumb. I'm sure if I was kid of about five I would have loved it, then again I wouldn't have been able to read the subtitles. I think this film should be called Just Call Me Unfunny."
163,大笑江湖,5,dafrosts,"If you're looking for a comedy with cool Kung-Fu fights, keep looking. This is a farce along the lines of Hot Shots & Hot Shot Part Deux. It's whole goal is to make fun of as many subjects as possible. It's an enjoyable waste of two hours. A perfect movie to play while doing laundry."
164,大笑江湖,6,chino_bonito,"This movie is one of the worst movies I've seen in 2011.It's supposed to be a kung fu comedy, and has some famous stars in it, however it's not the least funny, especially the guy who plays the shoemaker, I have never seen a more boring comedian in a movie.Most of the stars are way pass their prime, except for Erics Tsang who only has a minor role. Kelly Lin's role isn't supposed to be funny so I can't blame her. Jacky Wu, who's a famous talkshow host also only has a minor role, and they dubbed His voice with someone else's.Back to Xiao Shen-Yang who's the leading actor and I think He's actually very famous in China, I have only seen him once before and didn't find him to be funny, and He is certainly not funny in this movie.Overall I find this movie a waste of time and I don't recommend it"
